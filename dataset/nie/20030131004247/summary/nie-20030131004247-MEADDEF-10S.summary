[1]  Both the Arabic and Hebrew names for the city may mean "friend" - al-Khalil and Hevron - but the enmities between Israelis and Palestinians in Hebron are as strong as anywhere in the West Bank.
[2]  Hebron was the first West Bank town Jewish settlers moved into after the territory was captured by Israel in the 1967 war.
[3]  And it was the last West Bank town from which Israeli troops were redeployed as a result of the Oslo accords.
[4]  The long-delayed agreement signed in 1997 between Binyamin Netanyahu, then Israeli prime minister, and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat gave Palestinians control over 80% of the 120,000-strong Palestinian town (known as H1).
[5]  The remaining 20% (or H2) was held by Israeli troops in order to protect the 400-strong Jewish community, particularly those living in the centre of Hebron, along Martyrs Street.
[6]  Israel has imposed a curfew on the divided West Bank town of Hebron after sending in tanks and troops in its first big security operation since Tuesday's election.
[7]  The army also reported killing five suspected Palestinian militants in operations elsewhere in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
[8]  Troops searching for militants in Hebron made at least five arrests, while army bulldozers reportedly flattened stalls in the central market.
[9]  Israeli radio said the operation, which could last several days, was in response to pre-election violence in the area including the killing of three soldiers a week earlier.
[10]  The Israeli force entered Hebron on Thursday morning, shutting down local TV and radio stations, blocking off major roads with armour and storming Palestinian Authority offices, Palestinian sources say.
[11]  Two people were wounded elsewhere in the Strip when their car reportedly came under Israeli tank fire and Palestinian sources say Israeli bulldozers demolished three houses and two wells in the town of Rafah.
[12]  HEBRON, West Bank (AP) - An Israeli undercover patrol shot and killed two Palestinian militants in Tulkarem, including a militia leader, and the army demolished a Palestinian vegetable market and closed Palestinian police and TV stations in Hebron.
[13]  HEBRON, West Bank    Israeli army bulldozers demolished a Palestinian vegetable market in Hebron Thursday, as troops closed Palestinian police and TV stations in the West Bank city in a crackdown on suspected militants.
[14]  Soldiers fired live rounds and rubber-coated steel pellets at Palestinians who threw stones during the demolition of more than 100 market stalls.
[15]  The Israel Defense Forces yesterday launched a large-scale operation in Hebron with combined ground and armored forces carrying out search missions in an effort to capture wanted militants.
[16]  Also yesterday, two Palestinians were killed in Tul Karm; one was a member of the military wing of the Tanzim and the other's affiliation is not yet clear.
