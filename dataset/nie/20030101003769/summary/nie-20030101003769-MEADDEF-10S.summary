[1]  China has taken delivery of the first section of a futuristic high-speed train which levitates above the track.
[2]  The German-built "maglev" train uses powerful magnets to hold the vehicle a fraction of a centimetre (inch) above the lines as it travels at speeds of up to 400 km/h (249 mph).
[3]  If trials are successful, China is planning to build a 1,250km (777 mile) maglev rail link from the capital, Beijing, to Shanghai and other Chinese cities.
[4]  German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and Chinese Prime Minister Zhu Rongji have taken a test-ride in a German-built magnetic levitation (maglev) train.
[5]  The train links the Chinese city of Shanghai with its airport, and represents the latest application of maglev technology, in which the train literally floats above the track.
[6]  Mr Schroeder hopes China will choose the same German consortium for another planned high-speed rail link from Shanghai to the capital Beijing, thereby boosting the flagging German economy by billions of dollars.
[7]  The German railway consortium Transrapid says it has reached an agreement with China to build a high-speed levitation rail link in Shanghai.
[8]  Transrapid said the magnetic monorail link will be built by the end of 2003, and will allow passengers to travel at an average speed of 430km/h (270mph) between Shanghai's airport and the city centre.
[9]  ET SHANGHAI (Reuters) - German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder said on Tuesday the country had clinched a coveted deal with China to extend the world's first commercial magnetic levitation train after a successful test ride in Shanghai.
[10]  Shortly after hurtling at a smooth 270 mph with Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji on a 19 mile track from Shanghai's financial district to its international airport, Schroeder told reporters China has agreed to extend the line.
[11]  German Economy Minister Wolfgang Clement said Zhu wanted to lay the ground for an extension southwards to Hangzhou and northwards to Nanjing while Zhu was still in office, totaling an estimated 185 miles of high-speed rail.
[12]  Coasting on a magnetic cushion instead of on wheels, the maglev train carrying Schroeder and Zhu on Tuesday took just eight minutes to flash across the Shanghai airport link.
[13]  The high-speed train, scheduled for a trial run on Tuesday, is able to reach a maximum speed of up to 430 kilometers per hour, or 119 meters per second.
[14]  Employing the state-of-the-art electromagnetic levitation technology developed by Germany, the world's first commercial maglev train takes less than eight minutes to travel 30 kilometers, linking the Pudong International Airport to the city's sprawling subway system.
[15]  THE Shanghai line is the world's first commercial 'maglev' project.
[16]  Sitting back in comfort, passengers enjoy the spacious interior and the smooth ride. -- AP Instead of rolling on wheels, the trains ride on a magnetic cushion that reduces friction and allows them to zip quietly along at speeds of over 430 kmh.
[17]  Germany hopes the 30 km Shanghai line, which is built by the Transrapid consortium in a US$1 billion (S$1.74 billion) deal, will be the harbinger of bigger contracts.
[18]  SHANGHAI - Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji and German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder opened the world's first commercial magnetic levitation (maglev) train yesterday, with both sides having much to gain from its success.
[19]  It is built and designed by German engineering giants Siemens and ThyssenKrupp, which form the Transrapid consortium with the German government.
[20]  'I think the magnetic levitation train technology has a bright future in China,' said Mr Zhu, after riding on the train.
[21]  The sector hopes to develop a high-speed railway allowing trains to run at speeds of over 300 kmh, and to have all big cities and transport centres linked with high-speed trains in the first 20 years of this century.
