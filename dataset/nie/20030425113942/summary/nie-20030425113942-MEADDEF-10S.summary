[1]                  As foreign minister during the Gulf War, he was the Baghdad government's spokesman and became an instantly-recognisable figure in the Western media.
[2]                  Mr Aziz was born in 1936 near Mosul, northern Iraq.
[3]                  In 1984, Iraq and the US restored diplomatic relations after a meeting at the White House between Mr Aziz and President Reagan.
[4]                  Just this week the US warned Iran not to try to destabilise the Shia community in Iraq, something it believes could interfere with Iraq's road to democracy.
[5]                  He was freed on 10 April along with more than 40 other political prisoners after US-led forces took the city.
[6]                  Mr Saboowalla's family left Iraq at the time of the first Gulf war in 1990, shortly before he was arrested and later jailed for 20 years.
[7]                  The list includes Saddam Hussein and his inner circle, as well as senior Baath Party officials and military commanders - some of whom have already been apprehended.
[8]                  Mr Aziz was one of the best known members of the Iraqi government in the West and BBC Pentagon correspondent Nick Childs says it could be the most significant arrest by coalition forces so far.
[9]                  Mr Aziz may have information on the location of Saddam Hussein and any programmes to develop weapons of mass destruction.
[10]                  A former Iraqi exile who has declared himself governor of the Iraqi capital Baghdad, Mohammed Mohsen al-Zubaidi, told the BBC he gave the Americans the information that led them to arrest Mr Aziz and his family.
[11]                  Mr Aziz - a Christian in a mainly Sunni Muslim government - was not considered a member of Saddam Hussein's innermost circle, dominated by members of the Tikriti clan.
[12]                  As a member of the Revolutionary Command Council, Mr Aziz is wanted by the US for war crimes against Kuwait, Iran and his own people.
[13]                  None of the targeted officials was captured as US-led forces swept through Iraq, but the coalition says it has taken 12 into custody since the regime was overthrown.
