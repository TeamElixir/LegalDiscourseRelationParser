[1]  Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon has said an international plan for Middle East peace should not be taken seriously.
[2]  In an interview with Newsweek magazine, he said he was only ready to accept the concept of a Palestinian state provided that Israel controlled its external borders.
[3]  Mr Sharon again stressed that he wanted Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat removed from any position of influence.
[4]  "Israel's view is that the United States and Israeli vision are the only practical interpretations which could lead to peace in the Middle East," Sharon said in a statement issued later by his office.
[5]  Ariel Sharon's official campaign T-shirts have been linked to a terrorist group that wants to wipe out Israel, it was revealed last night.
[6]  Radin, Globe Staff, 1/20/2003 ERUSALEM - Prime Minister Ariel Sharon yesterday accused European leaders of prolonging the Israeli-Palestinian struggle by continuing to treat Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat as a legitimate partner for peace negotiations.
[7]  Responding to questions at a press conference for the international media nine days before national elections, Sharon said that Israel, the United States, and, to a lesser degree, Russia understand that Arafat is an obstacle to peace and should be ignored.
[8]  Sharon also said that European leaders are not as concerned for Israeli lives as they are for the lives of Palestinians, a situation that would have to be corrected if Europe wanted to be more involved in Mideast peacemaking efforts.
[9]  Sharon, leader of the right-wing Likud party, leads in the polls over the Labor party's Amram Mitzna.
[10]  JERUSALEM (AP) - A proposed Palestinian constitution cedes some power from the president to a prime minister and declares Islam the official religion, according to a partial draft obtained Monday by The Associated Press.
[11]  Meanwhile, with Israeli elections a week away, polls showed Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's Likud party widening its lead over the Labour party.
[12]  Current Labour chief Amram Mitzna - who supports an immediate return to peace talks on Palestinian statehood with Arafat, whom Sharon has boycotted - said he would not step down, but it appeared he could face such pressure in coming days.
[13]  Secretary of State Colin Powell, in a stiff reply to Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, said yesterday the United States plans to push ahead vigorously with the Quartet road map.
[14]  Sharon said earlier this week that European nations were biased in favor of the Palestinians and could not be Middle East mediators, referring to the Quartet as "nothing."
[15]  Some 50 percent of new immigrants from the former Soviet Union are still undecided about how they will vote in next week's elections, according to a survey conducted for the Likud party this week by The Applied Institute.
[16]  Sharon won resounding support (51.7 percent), followed by Lieberman (16.7 percent), Sharansky (8 percent) and Lapid (1.7 percent).
[17]  The Likud plans to focus its campaign on undecided voters during the remaining days before the Jan. 28 elections, seeking to explain voting procedures to new immigrants and to underline the connections between Ariel Sharon, the Likud party and the "Mahal" ballot.
