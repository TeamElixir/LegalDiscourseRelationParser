      <S SNO='41' PAR='41' RSNT='1'>Scott Nauman, whose men were guarding the compound, told CNN that Iraqis on the other side of the street  swarmed the convoy, shaking the vehicles, breaking out windows, throwing rocks at extremely close range.</S>

      <S SNO='50' PAR='50' RSNT='1'>Bremer s drive to destroy the legacy of Saddam s Baathist rule has laid off up to 400,000 Iraqis who worked in those now-disbanded institutions and have little prospect of reintegration into the new security forces being assembled.</S>
      <S SNO='51' PAR='51' RSNT='1'>Critics say the sweeping policy of firing the soldiers fails to distinguish among the hard men who enforced Saddam s cruel orders, the many who joined the party out of expediency and some who genuinely believed in its Arab nationalist ideology.</S>

      <S SNO='58' PAR='58' RSNT='1'>Odierno said the raids resulted in the capture of as many as 50 members of the Special Republican Guard and security forces, including one of Saddam s bodyguards.</S>
