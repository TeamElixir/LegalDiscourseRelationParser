[3]  BBC NEWS   World   Middle East   Iran 'identifies' al-Qaeda suspects
[4]  Iran says it has identified most of the al-Qaeda suspects it is currently holding in custody, but has refused release any of their names.
[5]  Several reports have stated that those held may include some of Osama Bin Laden's closest aides and even one of the al-Qaeda leader's sons.
[6]  However Iran did not confirm how many alleged al-Qaeda members it was holding, their nationalities or their names, citing "security concerns".
[7]  Last month Tehran announced Iran that it had rounded up several al-Qaeda members after US accusations that Iran-based members of the network had backed the May suicide bombings in Saudi Arabia.
[8]  These reportedly include al-Qaeda spokesman Sulaiman Abu Ghaith, Osama Bin Laden's son Saad Bin Laden and his security chief Saif al-Adel, sometimes regarded as al-Qaeda's current number three leader and alleged to have trained some of the 11 September hijackers.
[9]  But since then the US has also said that it was al-Qaeda members based in Iran who were responsible for planning May's suicide bombing attacks in the Saudi Arabian city of Riyadh, in which 34 people, including nine bombers, died.
[10]  QAEDA POISED TO ATTACK: U.N. -- PARIS - The United Nations will issue a report next week showing Osama bin Laden's al Qaeda network has some 800 members ready to strike economic or tourist targets, a French consultant to the report said yesterday.
[11]  Roland Jacquard, head of the International Observatory on Terrorism, said bin Laden sent a "third generation of al Qaeda" from Afghanistan before U.S.-led forces toppled Kabul's Taliban regime in November 2001.
[12]  The U.N. report would show "that before Sept. 11, Osama bin Laden anticipated the American attack and sent out about 800 fighters from Afghanistan, all top officers of al Qaeda," Jacquard told France 2 television.
[13]  AL-QAEDA'S sanctuary in Afghanistan was destroyed two years ago, and its leaders largely dispersed to Pakistan, Iran, Iraq and elsewhere around the world.
[14]  An alleged Al-Qaeda spokesman has warned that the group is planning another strike similar to those of Sept 11, 2001.
[15]  Intelligence officials in the US, Europe and Africa report that Al-Qaeda has stepped up its recruitment drive in response to the war in Iraq.
[16]  TEHERAN - Iran has extradited suspected members of the Al-Qaeda terror organisation who were recently identified while in custody, a government spokesman said.
[17]  Shi'ite Muslim Iran rejects all the charges and says it was always ideologically opposed to the Sunni Al-Qaeda network which Washington accuses of masterminding the Sept 11, 2001 attacks on US cities.
[18]  US officials alleged that Al-Qaeda operatives in Iran had planned the May 12 suicide bombing attacks in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, that killed 34 people, including eight Americans.
[19]  Recent visits to Teheran by Prince Saud, Foreign Minister of Saudi Arabia, and Sheikh Muhammad Khalid al-Ahmad al-Sabah, Kuwait's Interior Minister, suggest to diplomats that some of the suspects detained in Iran may be from the two Gulf Arab states.
[20]  US newspapers reported last month that Al-Qaeda suspects possibly in detention in Iran included Suleiman Abu Ghaith, a Kuwaiti who acted as the organisation's spokesman, and Saif al-Adel, an Egyptian believed to be its security chief.
[21]  NEW YORK - A Pakistani man has been charged with lying to the FBI about a bogus Al-Qaeda plot to attack New York City, prompting security measures that snarled traffic in two major tunnels for most of Saturday.
[22]  Khuram Yousifzai, 23, who lives in New York, was charged with telling the authorities on Saturday that Al-Qaeda was planning to bomb the Lincoln and Holland tunnels within 72 hours.
[23]  Iran Will Hand Over Al Qaeda   June 24, 2003 15:12:20
[24]  (AP) Iranian officials argue they would be unlikely to support al Qaeda.
[25]  Iran will turn over to Saudi Arabia a number of Saudi members of the al Qaeda terror network who are in Iranian prisons, a senior Iranian official said Tuesday.
[26]  The handover has been sought for weeks by Saudi Arabia, which launched a crackdown on al Qaeda after the May 12 suicide bombings in the kingdom's capital, Riyadh.
[27]  U.S. officials have said al Qaeda members in Iran had a role in that attack.
[28]  Iran has denied U.S. accusations that it's harboring al Qaeda, saying for weeks that it had members of the terror network in its prison but was still trying to identify them.
[29]  Those believed by the United States to be sheltering in Iran include Saif al Adel, once Osama bin Laden's chief of security; Mohammed al Masri, who ran the al Qaeda training camps in Afghanistan; and Abu Musab Zarqawi, the operational commander who Washington accuses of ties to Saddam Hussein.
