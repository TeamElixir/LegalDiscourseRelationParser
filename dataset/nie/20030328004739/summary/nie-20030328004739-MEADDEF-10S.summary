[2]  Bush signed the 25-page order three weeks before the government's April 17 deadline for declassifying millions of documents 25 years or older.

[5]  ASHINGTON -- The World Trade Organization has ruled that the stiff tariffs President Bush imposed last year to give US steel companies time to get back on their feet violated global trade rules, officials who have seen the preliminary decision said yesterday.
[6]  During the 2000 presidential election, Bush campaigned on a pledge to do more for domestic steel companies than the Clinton administration, which had refused to adopt tariffs that in the first year ranged from 8 percent to 30 percent over a wide range of steel products.
[7]  ASHINGTON -- The Senate delivered a rebuff to President Bush's domestic plans yesterday, approving a $2.2 trillion budget that provides less than half the $726 billion in tax cuts he says would rally the listless economy.
[8]  In a mostly party-line 56-44 roll call vote, the Republican-controlled chamber approved the fiscal blueprint, which endorses just $350 billion of the president's planned tax cuts through 2013.
[9]  The Republican-led House approved its own budget last week, embracing Bush's entire $726 billion tax-cutting economic plan, and GOP leaders are sure to drive the tax figure as high as they can in their compromise.
[10]  Even so, the Senate budget was a setback for Bush on one of the pillars of his domestic agenda.
[11]  It also spotlights the limits on Bush's ability to persuade lawmakers to support his policies at home, even though the war with Iraq has helped to keep his popularity high.
[12]  "I don't think, war or no war, those differences would be any differently reflected," Daschle said.
[13]  The votes were taken as Congress began considering Bush's $74.7 billion proposal to pay for the war with Iraq and other costs of the US campaign against terrorism at home and abroad.
[14]  CBC News:Anti-war artists to picket Barbara Bush in Toronto
[15]  Last Updated 2003-03-27 00:00:00.0 TORONTO - A Toronto-based group calling itself Artists Against War is set to picket an upcoming speech by the U.S.
[16]  Barbara Bush, who is married to former U.S President George Bush, is scheduled to appear at Roy Thomson Hall March 31st as part of the subscription series "Unique Lives."
[17]  Kristy Findlay, one of the organizers of the group, said the information picket in an opportunity to give Barbara Bush a strong anti-Iraq war message that she can send to her son, President George W.
[18]  Democratic Congressional leaders who have been critical of President Bush's Iraq policy said this morning that they will mute their criticism now that the conflict has begun.
[19]  Pelosi, who has been even more outspoken against the Bush Iraq policy over the last few months, echoed Daschle's words.
[20]  Tonight, President Bush has commanded U.S. forces to go to war in violation of American traditions of defensive war that have lasted since George Washington.
[21]  Karen Hughes has re-emerged as a top adviser to President Bush on the war against Iraq.
[22]  "George Bush should be focused on winning this war and making sure our troops are safe, not on how his partisan campaign hacks are going to score political points in the aftermath," David Sirota, a spokesman for the Democratic side of the House Appropriations Committee, told the Post.

[26]  War Does Little To Alter Bush Routine   March 23, 2003 04:46:28
[27]  President Bush meets with his war council at Camp David, Saturday, March 22, 2003.
[28]  (AP/The White House) "The president is following his normal routine."
[29]  War has brought little change to the regulated, by-the-numbers life of President Bush.
[30]  "The president is following his normal routine," Bush's spokesman, Ari Fleischer, said before the president left to spend the weekend, as he has often throughout his term, at the secluded Camp David presidential retreat in the silence of Maryland's Catoctin Mountains.
[31]  He has been working out almost every day, and a longtime Bush aide said he also seems to be sleeping well, is sticking to his diet and even giving up desserts as he tries to shave seconds off his running time.
[32]  And although White House aides were angry that a live feed was broadcast abroad of Bush being coifed and made up before his Wednesday night speech to the nation, the president himself joked later about whether he had looked OK, the official said.
[33]  Budget Deficit Could Hit Historic High   March 26, 2003 02:27:05
[34]  President Bush is seeking $74.7 billion as a down payment for six months of war in Iraq, and he wants it in less than three weeks.
[35]  Bush's spending request, $62.6 billion, will support U.S. troops both in Iraq and other operations related to the broader war on terrorism in the next six months, the White House said.
[36]  Bush Delivers Pep Talk To Troops   March 26, 2003 20:55:45
[37]  Central Command, President Bush vowed that nothing will divert the U.S. and its allies from victory in Iraq.
[38]  Bush spoke to hundreds of uniformed military personnel as rising U.S. and British casualties raised questions about American battle plans.
[39]  Bush spoke before receiving a classified military briefing at the headquarters of the Central Command, whose top general, Tommy Franks, is running the war against Iraq from a forward headquarters in Qatar.
[40]  Bush has not traveled within the United States since Feb. 20, a period in which he oversaw final preparations for battle and also a last-ditch effort to win U.N. backing for the war.
[41]  Fewer than half of the federal workers - 41 percent - said outstanding employees receive timely recognition.
[42]  More than one-third of federal employees say they are thinking about leaving their jobs as the Bush administration considers allowing private industry to bid for more government work, a survey shows.
