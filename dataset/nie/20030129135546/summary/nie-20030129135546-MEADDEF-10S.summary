[1]                  BBC News Online assesses the battle in the war against Osama Bin Laden's terror network.
[2]                  Hundreds of al-Qaeda suspects were rounded up, some senior leaders captured and interrogated - and yet the attacks go on.
[3]                  Although there is no conclusive evidence, it is widely believed that Osama Bin Laden's al-Qaeda network carried out the Mombasa bombing which killed 15.
[4]                  Again, there has been no evidence proving a direct link to al-Qaeda but officials investigating the explosion say they found speeches by Osama Bin Laden in a house rented by Imam Samudra - the man at the centre of the inquiry.
[5]                  Shortly before the Kenyan attacks a taped message, allegedly from Osama Bin Laden, was broadcast on the Qatar-based al-Jazeera TV station.
[6]                  The release of an al-Qaeda statement on 6 October by Bin Laden's deputy, Ayman al-Zawahiri, was followed six days later by the Bali blasts.
[7]                  Notably, the US also launched a missile strike inside Yemen which killed six alleged members of al-Qaeda, including Ali Qaed Senyan al-Harthi who was suspected of involvement in the 2000 bombing of the USS Cole in Yemen's Aden harbour.
[8]                  The key members of the al-Qaeda leadership, Ayman al-Zawahri, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and Osama Bin Laden himself have not been captured and, as recent attacks have shown, the terror networks are capable of striking targets all over the world and spreading fear and economic gloom in the process.1040965200
[9]                  Researchers in Switzerland have questioned the authenticity of the recent audio recording attributed to Osama Bin Laden.
[10]                  A team from the Lausanne-based Dalle Molle Institute for Perceptual Artificial Intelligence, Idiap, said it was 95% certain the tape does not feature the voice of the al-Qaeda leader.
[11]                  US intelligence officials have said they believe the recording - broadcast on the Arabic al-Jazeera television channel earlier this month - was almost certainly that of Osama Bin Laden.
[12]                  He said the system they had used was difficult to tamper with - the al-Jazeera tape was sufficiently different from other Bin Laden recordings as to raise doubts.
[13]                  It spoke of "the raids on New York and Washington" - an apparent reference to the 11 September attacks, widely blamed on Bin Laden and al-Qaeda.
[14]                  A new statement attributed to the al-Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden has been released, urging Muslims to join together in fighting their "external enemy".
[15]                  Shortly after the 11 September attacks, the US issued a list of al-Qaeda suspects.
[16]                  Al-Zawahri has appeared alongside Bin Laden in al-Qaeda videotapes released since 11 September.
[17]                  The 30-year-old, who is believed to have been born to Palestinian parents in Saudi Arabia, is also known as Zayn al-Abidin Mohammed Husain and Abd al-Hadi al-Wahab but has used dozens of other aliases.
[18]                  In November 2002, the US said it had captured a senior al-Qaeda member, Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri - believed to be leader of the network's operations in the Gulf.
[19]                  Pakistani security officials are questioning a number of Arab and Afghan nationals in connection with the passing on of an audio tape of Osama Bin Laden to the Islamabad-based correspondent of Arab television network al-Jazeera earlier this month.
[20]                  Reports say that the suspects are being interrogated by Pakistani intelligence service and American FBI officials over their possible involvement in delivering Osama Bin Laden's tape to the al-Jazeera television network.
[21]                  In the last year, Pakistani security forces assisted by the FBI have arrested a large number of al-Qaeda suspects including two key aides of Osama Bin Laden.

[23]                  NEW YORK    Osama bin Laden, Saudi-born millionaire turned Islamic terror chieftain, has been on the radar of the United States since the days when both he and the CIA were fighting the Soviet Army in Afghanistan.
[24]                  Dec. 27    In a videotape broadcast Thursday, Osama bin Laden called the Sept. 11 attacks a  blessed  response to U.S. policies and said the end of the United States was imminent.
[25]                  The suspected terrorist mastermind appeared gaunt on the 33-minute tape, which was shown in full for the first time Thursday by Arabic television network al-Jazeera.

[27]                  LONDON, Oct. 9    An audiotape of Ayman al-Zawahri, al-Qaida s fugitive second in command, appears to be genuine and to have been recorded in the last few weeks, a U.S. official said Wednesday.
