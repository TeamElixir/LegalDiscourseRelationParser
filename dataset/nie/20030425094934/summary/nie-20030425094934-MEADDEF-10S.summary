[1]                  Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (Sars) has killed more than 200 people worldwide, and infected almost 4,000.
[2]                  The figures are based on confirmed World Health Organization statistics released daily - figures in brackets indicate different totals released by health authorities in the region, which may vary from the WHO totals.
[3]                  It has sealed off two hospitals and ordered 4,000 people who have come into contact with suspected Sars patients to stay at home.
[4]                  BBC News Online looks at the actual risks faced by people around the world - and how they could change if the virus carries on spreading.
[5]                  However, overall there is still relatively little known about Sars - scientists do not fully understand how the virus is passed from person to person, or at what point a Sars carrier becomes contagious.
[6]                  Seats on planes are at a premium following the warning from the World Health Organisation (WHO) over the potentially fatal disease, according to UK tour operators.
[7]                  In the UK, the government has said it has a "clear strategy" for dealing with the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (Sars).
[8]                  The newspapers are filled with condemnation from politicians and local health experts of the World Health Organization's (WHO) recent warning against travelling to Canada's biggest city.
[9]                  First known case of Sars is discovered in Guangdong province, China.
[10]                  The Chinese Ministry of Health reports that there have been 300 cases including five deaths in Guangdong province from an "acute respiratory syndrome".
[11]                  The World Health Organisation (WHO) confirms that Severe Acute Respiratory syndrome (Sars) is a "worldwide health threat" and that possible cases have been identified in Canada, Indonesia, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.
[12]                  China apologises for its slow response to the Sars outbreak amid allegations that officials have covered up the true extent of the spread of the disease.
[13]                  The government has brought in emergency measures to quarantine people with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, but denied rumours that it planned to invoke martial law.
[14]                  China on Friday announced five more deaths from Sars, while six more people have died in Hong Kong - taking the death toll to 115 each.
[15]                  Senior health officials from across Asia have been meeting in Malaysia to consider emergency measures aimed at slowing the spread of Sars, which has killed more than 260 people worldwide.
[16]                  Joined by representatives from Canada - the only country outside Asia where people have died from Sars - the officials were expected to consider screening at borders and pooling information and resources.
[17]                  A Beijing health official said a further 4,000 individuals believed to have had contact with suspected Sars sufferers had been ordered to stay at home under quarantine.
[18]                  A WHO expert visiting China, Dr Wolfgang Preiser, has said the city of Shanghai may have been far luckier than Beijing in escaping the worst of the Sars outbreak, even though he believes there are tens of cases.
[19]                  The BBC's Francis Markus in Shanghai says people are not panicking like in Beijing, but people are worried as the authorities are expected to announce more Sars cases, maybe by broadening the definition of confirmed cases.1051286115
[20]                  A growing number of people from areas hardest hit by Sars have arrived in Australia to weather the emergency.
[21]                  Air India pilots are refusing to fly with any crew member who has travelled to a Sars-affected country in the past 10 days.
[22]                  The move comes a day after Indian health officials ordered tough new measures to combat Sars.
[23]                  The country has so far reported only five confirmed cases of Sars, but there is growing concern amongst health officials.
[24]                  Around 1.5 million people are infected with HIV in a country which, for a long time, officially denied the extent of the disease.
[25]                  Entire villages, particularly in central Henan province, were infected by HIV after a blood donor scandal spread the virus through the community.
[26]                  Dr Teresa Hesketh, who works with Aids in China, said that Sars was "a highly infectious disease, where, if your immune response is compromised with HIV, you are likely to die".
[27]                  However, Dr Wu Jun You, who works at China's National Centre for Aids and STD Control and Prevention, said that although "we do have concerns... we are not sure how the Sars virus would interact with the Aids virus."
[28]                  In Guangdong province, where Sars is thought to have originated, those infected with HIV/Aids had not demonstrated a higher risk, Dr Wu told BBC News Online.
[29]                  Henan, which is worst hit by the Aids virus, has reported only six cases of Sars so far, but Shanxi province, next door, has reported 141 cases.
[30]                  Fears that poor residents in rural China would not be able to afford the necessary treatment for Sars were mitigated by the fact that "there are no expensive treatments for Sars at the moment", Dr Hesketh said.
