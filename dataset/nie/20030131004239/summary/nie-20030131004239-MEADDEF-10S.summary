[1]  The mixed reponses in Europe to chief weapons inspector Hans Blix's report to the UN Security Council suggest that the opposition of some of America's allies remains a big obstacle to US plans to use military force.
[2]  Dr Blix has set Iraq a stiff test: to come clean about its illegal weapons and disarm quickly, or face "serious consequences", in the words of Security Council Resolution 1441.
[3]  UN Security Council meeting unlikely to result in early war against Iraq
[4]  UNITED NATIONS, Jan. 29 (Xinhuanet) -- After US President George W.Bush called in his State of the Union address for a UN Security Council meeting next Wednesday to decide the fate of Iraq, diplomats here doubted that the meeting would result in early war.
[5]  But diplomats said the meeting was unlikely to produce any conclusions or decisions on peace and war for Iraq, for the simple reason that the United States would definitely not drop its bombs over the heads of inspectors.
[6]  Besides, diplomats doubted that Washington would activate a vital "deliberate ambiguity" left in UN Security Council Resolution 1441 which would dispense with the need for the world's only superpower to seek a follow-up resolution before opening fire on Iraq immediately.
[7]  However, a diplomat closed to the council told Xinhua on condition of anonymity that a working schedule for the council during next month has already been finished, and Feb. 14 has been reserved to a closed council meeting on the situation in Iraq and Kuwait.
[8]  Germany's Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer will chair the council meeting next Wednesday, said the country's UN ambassador after the council met for a second time this week with UN Secretary General Kofi Annan and the chief weapons inspectors for Iraq.
[9]  Iraq has invited chief UN inspectors Hans Blix and Mohamed ElBaradei to return to Baghdad for talks.
[10]  NITED NATIONS - Most countries on the UN Security Council yesterday called for further diplomacy and for continued weapons inspections in Iraq, a day after President Bush warned of impending military action against Iraq's leader Saddam Hussein.
[11]  Major players of the 15-member council, including Russia, France, Germany, China, and Mexico, were among those that argued during yesterday's closed-door session that UN arms experts searching for banned weapons must be given more time - although they said Iraq should do far more to comply.
[12]  "The majority in the council is in favor of disarming Iraq in peaceful means, and the majority in the council is in favor of giving more time to inspectors," Jean-Marc de la Sabliere, France's ambassador to the UN, told reporters.
[13]  Iraq has until Dec. 8 to provide weapons inspectors and the Security Council with a complete declaration of all aspects of its chemical, biological and nuclear programs.
[14]  Yesterday's council meeting was the first since diplomats heard reports from top UN weapons inspectors on their first 60 days of work in Iraq.
[15]  UNITED NATIONS    The United States faces an uphill struggle in winning international support for a war against Iraq, with the majority of U.N.
[16]  Neither the largely negative reports from U.N. inspectors nor President Bush's State of the Union address, which tried to build a case for war, has altered the positions of key council members.
[17]  The Security Council is not scheduled to take up Iraq again until Powell comes to New York on Feb. 5 for a special meeting to present evidence of Iraq's secret weapons programs and links to terrorist groups.

[20]  The United States faces a really tough battle at the United Nations Security Council where a clear majority of permanent and non-permanent members are pushing for additional time for the weapons inspections process in Iraq.
