[15]  Make NYPOST.COM Calls for healing. -- BOSTON - The man put in charge of the scandal-wracked Boston Archdiocese after Bernard Cardinal Law's resignation called for healing and reconciliation yesterday, drawing applause as he celebrated Mass at the Cathedral of the Holy Cross.
[16]  It was Lennon's first appearance since the Vatican appointed him Friday to the post of apostolic administrator for an archdiocese that has been embroiled for the past year in a clergy sex-abuse scandal.
[17]  Law, who became a target of protests for not taking tougher steps to remove abusive priests, was in Boston yesterday but had no public appearances scheduled, archdiocese spokeswoman Donna Morrissey said.
[18]  "God willing, not only can things change, but things can improve," Lennon declared in a homily that was answered by a standing ovation from about 350 worshipers at the Cathedral of the Holy Cross.
[19]  Fifty-three hours after he was named by Pope John Paul II as apostolic administrator, overseeing the scandal-torn archdiocese until a new archbishop is named, Lennon shed little light on how he intends to salve the spiritual, legal, and financial wounds of the church.
[20]  Mitchell Garabedian, an attorney for numerous people who say they were molested by priests, described the homily as "significantly gentle, promising and hopeful," but said the victims of priests need "significant action by the archdiocese to help them heal."
[21]  Coyne said that Lennon had known as early as Dec. 11 that he was going to be named apostolic administrator of Boston, meaning that the Vatican had decided to let Law go well before Pope John Paul II accepted Law's resignation Dec. 13.
[22]  Hatch arrived at the Cathedral of the Holy Cross yesterday as an angry man, and he left an angry man.
[23]  That is some measure of the task before Bishop Richard Lennon.
[24]  He says he was abused by a priest when he was 16, and he clearly has not been satisfied by the response of the archdiocese to his suffering and that of so many others.

[27]  (AP) Attorney Roderick MacLeish, who represents hundreds of alleged victims in the Boston area, said he has decided to postpone a deposition of Law until Jan. 4, but litigation will continue with "no interruption or stand down."
[28]  (AP) Brooklyn Archbishop Thomas Daily, who was involved in the transfer of priests when he worked under Law in Boston, has put in a routine retirement letter and is waiting to see if the Pope approves it.
[29]  The Vatican decision came only three days after Pope John Paul II accepted the resignation of Cardinal Bernard Law as leader of the Boston archdiocese, of the oldest and most influential in the U.S.
[30]  After the service, Lennon left the cathedral, made his way through a crush of reporters and television cameras and talked briefly with protesters, some of whom say they are victims of abusive priests.
[31]  McCormack has been dogged for nearly a year by accusations that he failed to protect children from sexually abusive priests while he served in the Archdiocese of Boston as a top deputy to Law from 1984 to 1994.
[32]  Law: "... the most effective way that I might serve the church at this moment is to resign."
[33]  In his first public statement after his resignation, Cardinal Bernard Law apologized and begged forgiveness Monday from those who he said had suffered from his mistakes.
[34]  While not specifically mentioning the scandal involving alleged sexual abuse by priests and the cover-up by church officials, Law, 71, said it is his prayer that the Archdiocese of Boston will experience healing, reconciliation, and unity.
[35]  Earlier this year, Law wrote a letter to priests in the archdiocese acknowledging there were problems but saying he would not resign.
[36]  The resignation came amid recent allegations by Massachusetts' attorney general that the Boston archdiocese engaged in "an elaborate scheme" to keep quiet the issue of child sexual abuse by priests.
[37]  Law, making his first public appearance since resigning as archbishop, offered another apology and asked for forgiveness Monday for his role in the clergy sex abuse scandal that rocked the Boston Archdiocese.
[38]  "As I said last Friday, it is my hope and it's my prayer that my resignation as archbishop might help the Archdiocese of Boston to experience healing, to experience reconciliation and to experience unity," Law told reporters at a brief news conference.
[39]  Law, 71, said new policies and programs have been put in place in the past 11 months that he hoped would prevent future abuses by priests.
[40]  Law expressed uncertainty about his future, and said he plans to take a brief vacation with fellow priests after Christmas and later retreat to a monastery.
[41]  Law had become the lightning rod for the displeasure of alleged victims, parishioners and, eventually, fellow priests who criticized his handling of the scandal that ensnared dozens of priests and eventually spread to dioceses around the country.
[42]  The crisis erupted nearly a year ago, after previously secret church documents revealed that Law had shuffled offending priests from parish to parish, rather than removing them.
[43]  Criticism against Law intensified with the release of the files, culminating with a petition signed by nearly 60 priests in the archdiocese calling on Law to resign.
[44]  In a statement released in Rome after Pope John Paul II accepted his resignation Friday, Law begged for forgiveness from "all those who have suffered" from his failure to crack down on rogue priests who molested children for decades.
[45]  On Monday, attorney Mitchell Garabedian, who represents many alleged victims, criticized Lennon in a televised interview, saying he had an obligation to report to civil authorities alleged abuse by a priest whom Lennon worked to defrock in the mid-1990s.
