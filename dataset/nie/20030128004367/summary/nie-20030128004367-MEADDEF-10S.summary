[1]  Bangkok Post Tuesday 28 January, 2003 - EU fails to resolve row over Zimbabwe sanctions
[2]  EU foreign ministers failed Monday to agree to rollover sanctions against Zimbabwe, amid a row sparked by a French invitation for President Robert Mugabe to visit Paris next month.
[3]  The Greek EU presidency referred the thorny issue to EU ambassadors for further discussion, but added the row could yet scupper an EU-Africa summit in three months' time.
[4]  "We will try to get a consensus .. if not we may not have a summit," said Greek Foreign Minister George Papandreou, referring to the summit due in Lisbon in April.
[5]  But French President Jacques Chirac clouded the matter by extending an invitation to Mugabe last week, arguing his presence at the February 20-21 Franco-Africa summit would help promote democracy, justice and human rights in Zimbabwe.
[6]  "What worries the Portuguese is that from their contacts with the African countries, were Mugabe not allowed to attend they might have a boycott on their hand, but on the other hand several EU heads of state would not want to attend if Mugabe came," he said.
[7]  Some EU members have been seeking a compromise that would allow Zimbabwe's Foreign Minister Stan Mudenge to attend the Africa summit in Lisbon in place of Mugabe, although Mudenge would need a travel waiver as well.
[8]  The EU wanted to keep the door open to sit down with Zimbabwean leaders and attack their record on human rights, the diplomat said, but did not want to see Mugabe or his associates coming freely to Europe for holidays or shopping trips.
[9]  European Union foreign ministers have failed to decide on a new package of sanctions against the government of Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe at a meeting in Brussels.
[10]  This comes after France angered a number of countries by inviting Mr Mugabe to attend a Franco-African summit in Paris to discuss human rights and democracy next month.
[11]  But the ban expires a day before the summit and the UK wants to see the travel restrictions, sanctions and a freeze on his assets renewed.
[12]  Isolating Mugabe makes him seem as a hero to thousands of the masses in Zimbabwe, who will easily accept Mugabe's assertion that Zimbabwe's economic woes are a result of acts of sabotage by the ethnic Europeans in Zimbabwe.
[13]  Munos M.B., Zimbabwe There is no way the Europeans have the guts to ban Mugabe, everyone moans about this evil dictator but the EU has not got the guts to do anything about him, to cure dictators you have to oust them, ie Saddam Hussien.
[14]  Robert Mugabe has beaten Morgan Tsvangirai to win a controversial fifth term as Zimbabwe's president.
[15]  President Robert Mugabe has faced press criticism recently for going on a "shopping spree" while visiting the Far East.
[16]  The decision by French President Jacques Chirac to invite Robert Mugabe to a Franco-African summit in Paris in February has angered those across Europe who want Zimbabwe's president to remain an international pariah.
[17]  Last year the EU banned Mr Mugabe from travelling to Europe, after a Zimbabwean presidential election marred by violence and fraud.
[18]  The measures currently in force include a travel ban on senior government figures, but France has invited Mr Mugabe to a Franco-African summit in Paris next month, angering several countries.
[19]  France argues that EU sanctions against Zimbabwe allow officials to attend meetings in Europe if the focus is on human rights and democracy.
[20]  Diplomats suggest that the sanctions regime will be re-imposed but an exception will be granted to allow Mr Mugabe to circumvent the ban to allow him to attend the meeting in Paris.
[21]  This had led to some EU members seeking a compromise that would have seen Zimbabwe's Foreign Minister Stan Mudenge attend the summit in Lisbon in his place - although the minister would also need a travel waiver.
[22]  Leading members of the European Union have officially complained over France's decision to invite Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe to a summit in Paris.
[23]  Britain, Germany, Sweden and the Netherlands say the invitation is in breach of the diplomatic sanctions imposed by the EU against Mugabe and his administration last year.
[24]  EU foreign ministers were meeting on Monday to debate extending the diplomatic measures against Zimbabwe.
[25]  The 15-nation EU imposed a visa ban on Mugabe and 19 of his close associates in February 2002 after Zimbabwe expelled the head of an EU team of election observers.
[26]  The EU says Mugabe's government has violated human rights and pursued policies that lead Zimbabwe into unprecedented economic and political chaos.
[27]  France has said it wants Mugabe to attend the 22nd Conference of the Heads of State of Africa from February 19-21 on the grounds that it will be an opportunity to raise political and human rights complaints.
[28]  France says provisions in the travel ban allow for trips to conduct a political dialogue aimed at promoting democracy, the rule of law and human rights in Zimbabwe.
