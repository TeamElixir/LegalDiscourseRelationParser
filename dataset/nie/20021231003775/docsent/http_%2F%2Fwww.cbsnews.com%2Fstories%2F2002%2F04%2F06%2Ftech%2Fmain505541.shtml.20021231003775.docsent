      <S SNO='2' PAR='2' RSNT='1'>NEW YORK, Dec. 30, 2002 Boisselier said a pediatrician has seen the baby and that the child is "doing fine."</S>
      <S SNO='3' PAR='3' RSNT='1'>She also said a second cloned baby is due to be born next week to a lesbian couple in northern Europe.</S>
      <S SNO='4' PAR='4' RSNT='1'>Brigitte Boisselier, a chemist at Clonaid, announcing the claim of an historic discovery.</S>
      <S SNO='5' PAR='5' RSNT='1'>(AP) A company called Clonaid claims to have cloned the first human being and says the baby named Eve is coming to America Monday with her family.</S>
      <S SNO='6' PAR='6' RSNT='1'>The baby is flying into the U.S. with her family Monday, Brigitte Boisselier said, two days after she announced the child's birth.</S>
      <S SNO='7' PAR='7' RSNT='1'>Boisselier is chief executive of Clonaid, the cloning company affiliated with the Raelians, a religious sect that believes space aliens launched life on Earth.</S>
      <S SNO='8' PAR='8' RSNT='1'>"I think it's a big step for human beings in the future.</S>
      <S SNO='9' PAR='9' RSNT='1'>It will bring us eternal life.</S>
      <S SNO='10' PAR='10' RSNT='1'>That's the best thing that can happen to humanity.</S>
      <S SNO='11' PAR='11' RSNT='1'>We can not only cure all diseases but also it will give us eternal life,  said Claude Vorilhon on The former French journalist founded Clonaid and is the leader of a sect called the Raelians.</S>
      <S SNO='12' PAR='12' RSNT='1'>Vorilhon, who calls himself Rael, claims a space alien visiting him in 1973 revealed that extraterrestrials had created all life on Earth through genetic engineering.</S>
      <S SNO='13' PAR='13' RSNT='1'>Boisselier, who claims two chemistry degrees, identifies herself as a Raelian "bishop" and said Clonaid retains philosophical but not economic links to the Raelians.</S>
      <S SNO='14' PAR='14' RSNT='1'>So far there has been no independent confirmation of the possible breakthrough.</S>
      <S SNO='15' PAR='15' RSNT='1'>Boisselier offered no scientific proof, provided no photographs and did not produce the child or the mother, who she said is a 31-year-old with an infertile husband.</S>
      <S SNO='16' PAR='16' RSNT='1'>Her announcement was met with doubt by the scientific community and revulsion by many ethicists.</S>
      <S SNO='17' PAR='17' RSNT='1'>I don't believe that this group has the scientific expertise, the know-how to bring this off.</S>
      <S SNO='18' PAR='18' RSNT='1'>The best cloners in the world are in veterinary medicine.</S>
      <S SNO='19' PAR='19' RSNT='1'>They make it work in about 1 in 400 times,  said Art Caplan, director of the Department of Medical Ethics at the University of Pennsylvania.</S>
      <S SNO='20' PAR='20' RSNT='1'>"If you looked at the outcomes of cloning in animals, one half of the animals that have been cloned, pigs, sheep, cows, are dead within a year, and of the survivors, almost all of them have health problems.</S>
      <S SNO='21' PAR='21' RSNT='1'>Dolly the sheep has arthritis, and seizures, and growth disorders, and immune diseases.</S>
      <S SNO='22' PAR='22' RSNT='1'>What I'm ashamed of is that someone could come on TV and say yes well we're going to have eternal life.</S>
      <S SNO='23' PAR='23' RSNT='1'>I think cloning right now, as we understand it, is the road to eternal sickness,  he added.</S>
      <S SNO='24' PAR='24' RSNT='1'>To gain convincing proof that "Eve" is a clone, Boisselier said she had accepted an offer by a former ABC News science editor who has chosen independent experts to draw DNA from the mother and the newborn and test them for a match.</S>
      <S SNO='25' PAR='25' RSNT='1'>"The baby is going home and once at home it is possible for an independent expert to go there and once a sample is taken we will see," Boisselier said on Sunday, referring to DNA testing needed to prove whether the child is really a clone.</S>
      <S SNO='26' PAR='26' RSNT='1'>"On Monday if a sample is taken, perhaps by the end of the week or early next week we should have all the details."</S>
      <S SNO='27' PAR='27' RSNT='1'>Boisselier previously said the child's mother is American but has offered no further details.</S>
      <S SNO='28' PAR='28' RSNT='1'>On Sunday, neither she nor Clonaid spokeswoman Nadine Gary would say where in the United States the mother is from, where the child was born or what U.S. city they would be arriving in.</S>
      <S SNO='29' PAR='29' RSNT='1'>Both said details were being kept secret to protect the child and its family.</S>
      <S SNO='30' PAR='30' RSNT='1'>Boisselier's comments Sunday came two days after she announced at a Florida news conference that Clonaid scientists had produced the world's first cloned baby.</S>
      <S SNO='31' PAR='31' RSNT='1'>She said "Eve," a healthy 7-pound girl, was delivered by Caesarean section Thursday and is an exact genetic copy of her mother.</S>
      <S SNO='32' PAR='32' RSNT='1'>Boisselier said a pediatrician has seen the baby and that the child is "doing fine."</S>
      <S SNO='33' PAR='33' RSNT='1'>She also said a second cloned baby is due to be born next week to a lesbian couple in northern Europe.</S>
      <S SNO='34' PAR='34' RSNT='1'>Boisselier had previously announced that four other couples, including the lesbians, were expected to give birth to Clonaid-created clones by early February.</S>
      <S SNO='35' PAR='35' RSNT='1'>The United States has no specific law against human cloning.</S>
      <S SNO='36' PAR='36' RSNT='1'>But the U.S.</S>
      <S SNO='37' PAR='37' RSNT='1'>Food and Drug Administration, which regulates human experiments, says its regulations forbid human cloning without prior agency permission, and it has launched an investigation into whether Clonaid illegally performed any work on U.S. soil.</S>
