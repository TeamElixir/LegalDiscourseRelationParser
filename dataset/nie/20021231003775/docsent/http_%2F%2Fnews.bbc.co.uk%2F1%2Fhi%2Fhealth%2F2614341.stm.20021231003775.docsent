      <S SNO='2' PAR='2' RSNT='1'>Prosecutors in South Korea have seized documents from a biotechnology company linked to a controversial sect which claims to have created the world's first cloned baby.</S>
      <S SNO='3' PAR='3' RSNT='1'>After raiding the offices of BioFusion Tech Inc. in the southern city of Daegu, officials questioned members of staff to see whether they had taken part in the cloning project.</S>
      <S SNO='4' PAR='4' RSNT='1'>Cloning is not illegal in South Korea, but prosecutors may be investigating whether staff have been carrying out medical research without a licence.</S>
      <S SNO='5' PAR='5' RSNT='1'>Last week, scientists from Clonaid - a US-based firm linked to the Raelian sect - said that they had helped a woman give birth to a cloned baby girl.</S>
      <S SNO='6' PAR='6' RSNT='1'>However, the announcement has been viewed with deep scepticism by the scientific community at large - and no proof has so far been put forward.</S>
      <S SNO='7' PAR='7' RSNT='1'>"The investigators broke through windows into my house and the offices in Seoul and Daegu to seize documents," BioFusion Tech Inc. spokesman Kwak Gi-Hwa told the AFP news agency.</S>
      <S SNO='8' PAR='8' RSNT='1'>Mr Kwak said he and the firms president were banned from leaving the country.</S>
      <S SNO='9' PAR='9' RSNT='1'>South Korea's Yonhap news agency also reported that the prosecutors interrogated a South Korean woman, who had allegedly signed up for the cloning project.</S>
      <S SNO='10' PAR='10' RSNT='1'>BioFusion Tech Inc. - Clonaid's South Korean subsidiary - has been under investigation since July, after the firm said three South Korean women were taking part in the project and one of them was pregnant with a cloned foetus.</S>
      <S SNO='11' PAR='11' RSNT='1'>Clonaid began its operation in South Korea this year, and about 5,000 Koreans are believed to follow the Raelian cult.</S>
      <S SNO='12' PAR='12' RSNT='1'>Human cloning is not illegal in South Korea, and a bill outlawing the practice is currently being debated in the parliament.</S>
      <S SNO='13' PAR='13' RSNT='1'>But if officials without licences are found to have carried out any medical research, they could face up to five years in jail or $18,000 in fines, according to Yonhap agency.</S>
      <S SNO='14' PAR='14' RSNT='1'>Clonaid is linked to the Raelian sect, whose founder, Claude Vorilhon describes himself as a prophet and calls himself Rael.</S>
      <S SNO='15' PAR='15' RSNT='1'>The Raelians believe humans are the result of a genetic engineering project run by super-intelligent extra-terrestrials.</S>
      <S SNO='16' PAR='16' RSNT='1'>Clonaid has been racing against the Italian fertility doctor Severino Antinori to produce the first cloned baby.</S>
      <S SNO='17' PAR='17' RSNT='1'>Mr Antinori has claimed that one of his patients will give birth to a cloned baby in January.</S>
