Sect Says First Cloned Baby Goes Home
MIAMI (Reuters) - The head of a company that says it has produced the first human clone said on Monday that the mother and baby were home following the child's birth last week and genetic proof demanded by scientists and other skeptics should be available in a week.
Brigitte Boisselier, chief executive of Clonaid, which is linked to a group that believes mankind was created by extraterrestrials, declined to say whether the 31-year-old American mother and her child were in the United States or elsewhere.
Her claim to have cloned a human being drew skeptical reaction from experts in the field and she offered no proof, but told Reuters that genetic testing was scheduled for Tuesday.
"Hopefully it's going to be done tomorrow," she said.
"At least the (genetic) sampling should be done tomorrow.
We're working on it to make sure everything is going fine."
Boisselier announced on Friday in Florida that the company had produced the first human clone with the birth of a 7-pound baby girl called Eve.
The U.S.
Food and Drug Administration, which strongly opposes human cloning, said on Friday it was "taking steps to investigate" Clonaid's claim.
It said the implantation of a cloned baby into a woman is illegal in the United States without FDA approval.
Clonaid was founded by the creator of the Raelian Movement, a group that claims 55,000 followers around the world and asserts that life on Earth was sparked by extraterrestrials who arrived 25,000 years ago and created humans through cloning.
Cattle, mice, sheep and other animals have been cloned with mixed success.
Some have displayed defects later in life and scientists fear the same could happen with cloned humans.
The Raelians' founder, Claude Vorilhon, a French native known as Rael to his followers, told the Miami Herald on Sunday that Clonaid has a list of 2,000 people willing to pay $200,000 to have themselves or a loved one cloned.
Vorilhon, who describes himself as a prophet, told the Herald that he had distanced himself from Clonaid since its founding but expected the company to make money and to ultimately create eternal life.
"It's a commercial company and her goal is to make as much money as possible, and I hope she will make as much money as possible," Vorilhon said of Boisselier.
He said scientists may develop technology within 25 years to create a full-grown human clone in hours and to "upload" the contents of a person's brain into the clone.
"It's a very beautiful step, but it's just a step," Vorilhon, 56, told the Herald, referring to the alleged cloning of Eve.
"The ultimate goal is to give eternal life to humanity through cloning."
Boisselier told Reuters she would not reveal whether the mother and child were in the United States out of concerns for their security.
"They are at home.
They came home today ...
I don't want to disclose anything about their home," she said.
"We are very concerned about (their security)," she added.
"We don't want the parents to be bothered at any time ... until they are ready."
Boisselier said she was aware that some experts in the field had questioned whether her company was capable of producing a clone and others had called the claim a hoax.
"It's funny because they are insulting me each time they say that," she said.
"They won't say that to other scientists."
Boisselier said an independent expert selected by former ABC science correspondent Michael Guillen was to perform the genetic testing on the baby and results should take about a week, after which proof of Clonaid's claim would be made public.
She said she did not know the expert selected.
"We don't expect Mr.
Guillen to become available for comment until everyone knows indeed whether or not this is a genuine clone," said an employee of a New York publicist that represents Guillen.

Ring May Be Smuggling Men Into U.S.
Alleged Clone Said Headed for U.S.
Today Copyright   2002 ABCNEWS Internet Ventures.
Korean Woman said Pregnant With Clone
Prosecutors are trying confirm testimony from Clonaid officials in Seoul that a South Korean woman impregnated with a cloned human embryo left the country in July, local media reported.
The testimony came during questioning of officials at the South Korean office of Clonaid, a U.S.-based religious sect that claimed last week it had produced the world's first cloned baby, national Yonhap news agency quoted unnamed prosecution officials as saying Monday.
Clonaid had said four other couples including two from Asia are expected to give birth to clones by early February, in addition to the American woman they said had already given birth to the cloned baby called Eve.
Officials in Seoul spoke of the South Korean woman as still being pregnant.
Clonaid said Sunday that the cloned baby Eve and her family were going to return home to the United States Monday, but where they live and further details were not released.
Clonaid officials did not answer phone messages and e-mails Monday from The Associated Press.
In Seoul, South Korean prosecutors had opened an investigation in July after the sect's local office said a Korean woman had been successfully impregnated with the cloned embryo with help from BioFusion Tech, a firm based in the southeastern city of Daegu.
Expanding their investigation, prosecution investigators have recently seized documents and other research data from BioFusion and questioned its officials, Yonhap said.
Investigators confirmed that three Korean women applied to have cloned human embryos implanted and located one of them, a former model identified only by her surname Kim, it said.
They said Lee testified that she applied for the cloning test but had never been implanted with a cloned embryo, it said.
Prosecution officials refused to comment on the report.
The prosecution probe has focused on whether the companies violated existing laws that ban unlicensed, unethical medical activities or practices.
South Korea has no law banning human cloning yet, but has been accelerating efforts to enact its first law against human cloning since the investigations began in July.
The Science and Technology Ministry has drafted a bill that calls for a prison term of up to 10 years for those who attempt or help to clone humans.
Research on embryonic stem cells could revolutionize the treatment of diseases such as cancer and Parkinson's disease.
But the research is controversial because embryos must be destroyed to recover the stem cells.
Clonaid was founded in 1997 by the Raelian Movement, a sect that believes life on earth was created by clones of extraterrestrials.
The Raelian Movement claims a membership of 55,000 worldwide.
Yonhap said there are 5,000 followers in South Korea.
Most cloning experts are opposed to cloning for reproductive purposes, citing numerous birth defects and other serious problems affecting cloned animals.

US Government probes cloning claim
The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has launched an investigation into claims by a US-based company, Clonaid, that it has created the first-ever cloned human baby.
The FDA - which regulates human trials in the US - says it is looking into the allegations even though the company said the cloning had occurred outside the country.
Clonaid, which is linked to a sect that believes aliens created humans by cloning, said on Friday that it had produced a human clone and that four more would be born soon.
The claim has met with deep scepticism among scientists, and has led to renewed calls by world leaders to ban human cloning.
Although the process is not illegal in the US, any human trial needs to be approved by the FDA.
The agency says it needs to establish whether Clonaid illegally performed any of the work on US soil.
"We want to check and see first whether the cloning did take place, and second if it violated any of our laws," FDA spokesman Brad Stone said.
Clonaid scientist Brigitte Boisselier said the first human clone - a girl nicknamed Eve - was born on Thursday to an American mother.
Clonaid announced that mother and daughter would be returning to the US on Monday - it is not known where they are at the moment.
Dr Boisselier said four other women were due to give birth to cloned babies in the coming weeks - one in Europe, another in North America and two in Asia.
Clonaid gave no details and offered no evidence of its alleged success, but said independent scientists would be allowed to test the mother and her daughter.
A leading British fertility expert, Lord Winston, said most researchers would regard Clonaid's claims as "ludicrous".
Harry Griffin, the head of Scotland's Roslin Institute which created Dolly the sheep as the world's first cloned animal, said all scientists had reported high numbers of miscarriages, deaths after birth and other problems with cloned animals.
There have also been growing demands around the world for a ban on human cloning.
In France - where it is already illegal - President Chirac has called on all countries to rally behind a Franco-German proposal for a global ban on human cloning, which has been submitted to the United Nations.
"Whatever the truth behind the announcement, the president of the republic takes this opportunity to reiterate his strong condemnation of all research into human reproductive cloning," President Chirac said in a statement on Friday.
US President George W Bush says the process is "deeply troubling", and has urged Congress to enact a ban.
Clonaid is linked to the Raelian sect, which believes humans were created by extra-terrestrial beings who had mastered genetic engineering.
The sect was founded in France in 1973, and later moved to Quebec.
It founded Clonaid in 1997.

Clone cult firm raided in S Korea
Prosecutors in South Korea have seized documents from a biotechnology company linked to a controversial sect which claims to have created the world's first cloned baby.
After raiding the offices of BioFusion Tech Inc. in the southern city of Daegu, officials questioned members of staff to see whether they had taken part in the cloning project.
Cloning is not illegal in South Korea, but prosecutors may be investigating whether staff have been carrying out medical research without a licence.
Last week, scientists from Clonaid - a US-based firm linked to the Raelian sect - said that they had helped a woman give birth to a cloned baby girl.
However, the announcement has been viewed with deep scepticism by the scientific community at large - and no proof has so far been put forward.
"The investigators broke through windows into my house and the offices in Seoul and Daegu to seize documents," BioFusion Tech Inc. spokesman Kwak Gi-Hwa told the AFP news agency.
Mr Kwak said he and the firms president were banned from leaving the country.
South Korea's Yonhap news agency also reported that the prosecutors interrogated a South Korean woman, who had allegedly signed up for the cloning project.
BioFusion Tech Inc. - Clonaid's South Korean subsidiary - has been under investigation since July, after the firm said three South Korean women were taking part in the project and one of them was pregnant with a cloned foetus.
Clonaid began its operation in South Korea this year, and about 5,000 Koreans are believed to follow the Raelian cult.
Human cloning is not illegal in South Korea, and a bill outlawing the practice is currently being debated in the parliament.
But if officials without licences are found to have carried out any medical research, they could face up to five years in jail or $18,000 in fines, according to Yonhap agency.
Clonaid is linked to the Raelian sect, whose founder, Claude Vorilhon describes himself as a prophet and calls himself Rael.
The Raelians believe humans are the result of a genetic engineering project run by super-intelligent extra-terrestrials.
Clonaid has been racing against the Italian fertility doctor Severino Antinori to produce the first cloned baby.
Mr Antinori has claimed that one of his patients will give birth to a cloned baby in January.

Should human cloning be banned?
As a US company with links to a religious sect claims to have cloned the first human baby, politicians and scientists are calling for the process to be outlawed.
The scientist leading Clonaid's efforts, Dr Brigitte Boisselier, said she was "celebrating a scientific success" after the birth of a girl called Eve on Boxing Day.
But US President George W Bush called on Congress to outlaw human cloning and French President Jacques Chirac said the development was "criminal and contrary to human dignity".
The question of banning is academic, since it would be unenforceable.
However, there are plenty of nightmare scenarios in store for us; deformities, premature death, clone psychosis, clones of Osama Bin Laden..
God help us.
I think that it isn't possible to clone a human, because with an animal, nowadays, it's difficult and to do it with a human is a dream.
It's also unethical; it doesn't respect human dignity.
What exactly are people hoping to achieve with such an experiment?
Surely time spent researching cloning would be time better spent exploring ways to help those already in existence, in fighting disease and the afflictions of today's world.
Does man's arrogance know no limits?
To all those who say that research that is unnatural should be stopped, if it wasn't for doing the unnatural we would still be living in caves.
I bet the first ever religious argument was over whether this new fangled fire stuff was stealing god's light and warmth.
It is being unnatural that defines us as separate from animals!
Tampering with nature is never a good idea.
Animals which have been cloned have acquired medical difficulties which emerged as they matured.
Human cloning is selfish, unethical and dangerous - remember, Hitler and the Nazis were working on it!
We need to learn to live with the cards that nature has dealt us.
I think cloning is against GOD and humanity further more we don't know what those creatures will turn into.
Let God do His work and us humans be humans.
I don't have a problem with cloning on a philosophical level, but I think it is cruel to experiment genetically with human beings.
We don't know how long these cloned children will live or if they will suffer debilitating defects.
It is one thing to clone sheep, but irresponsible to clone a human being until we know what the effects will be.
Sexual reproduction has been amazingly successful - look at the huge diversity of life that it has produced over the past billion years.
Asexual reproduction (cloning) really is a step back into the primeval.
Will we be sending clones of the Human Race to another planet for survival should the world blow up?
What utter rubbish cloning is, along with the shallow minds of the scientists pursuing the dream of eternity.
This world will pass and has to end one day.
Accept it!
Of course it must be banned.
There is no need to clone a human at all.
Nothing religious about it, nor good science - just bad morality and no clear obvious use.
I have to admit that while I am a little concerned about who did the cloning, at the same time I'm very excited about what has just happened.
This is indeed one of these great leaps forward for the human race.
Let's just make sure we proceed responsibly.
Here's a thought for all of you out there: Someday you may be cloned without even knowing it.
All they need is a wimpy cell - scary?
Or something you all are looking forward to?
This is a step closer to understanding our gene structure and how to correct genetic faults.
We have to move on.
Up to now, cloning humans still symbolizes more the progress of biotechnology than its real contribution to human beings.
Even if it could be accepted one day, those who benefit are mostly the rich instead of the man in need, which causes the increasing rich-poor discrepancy.
This is shocking what these people have done.
God will certainly punish them for this hideous crime against mankind.
Why could cloning humans not be as natural as pregnancy?
It is because the result could be influenced by the will of the other people - scientists.
For one thing, they gain God-like power.
For another, they are not so perfect as God, thus mistakes will inevitably occur.
To minimize the faults, more kinds of people are needed and more and more problems follow.
After all, pregnancy is the best policy.
Congratulations to Clonaid!
This announcement is a new landmark in biotechnology.
And while sceptics say they're afraid that the baby won't be in good health, they're just as afraid that it will be.
What is the use of having a perfect baby or a baby that is just like you?
If this is the future then we won't even need to be here to have children.
In India, burdened with the world's second largest population, we tend to see the cloning of human beings differently.
There are already enough members of mankind and that it is vital for the living and for those to come (by natural birth) to live as happily and as well as the circumstances allow them to.
It is equally vital not to prevent them from living better.
As for infertile parents, there are enough orphans in the world to take care of.
That's great.
The next step will be to produce a whole class of love slaves!
I say this cloning affair is exciting!
Hopefully, it will stir up major international debates about ethics and science.
The back-and-forth of whether Iraq has weapons was getting rather boring!
Let the science go forward.
There will always be good and bad in every new discovery.
It is a human evolution and we all hope the good will prevail.
The scientist in me is quivering with anticipation.
The human being in me is deeply troubled.
I think cloning is a crime against humanity and God.
We have no right to mess with nature in this way.
There is too many risks.
Life should be more special.
If one can "clone himself" by genetic technology, then he will not take his life as an important thing.
And isn't the cloned baby a human who will have her own ideas in the future?
What will she think about this kind of thing that happened to her?
Any ban on cloning will foster illegal cloning and cloning research in countries that do not have or enforce such a ban.
This merely precludes many reputable people from research in uses of cloning to advance mankind, while those of questionable motives will defy the ban and exploit both the evils and benefits of cloning.
Jacob Stansbury, Jr., United States of America I don't see any problem with cloning.
Lots of people overreact because they are afraid of what they don't know.
If the society had decided to ban planes because humans were not supposed to fly, where would we be now?
Furthermore, clones have always existed naturally; we call them twins.
In vitro reproduction is praised by some for giving the opportunity to infertile couples to have a baby; why is it so much more shocking with cloning?
Cloning should be banned.
In all our research and discovery, we need to base our actions on Christian principles, having due regard to God's commandments and the general tenor of scripture.
As we look back throughout mankind's history, we have always ventured into unknown territory with the arrogant presumption that because we can create something, that we fully understand the implications.
Genetic engineering is the ultimate fashion science.
Just because we can do something, does that mean we must?
Cloning is the best thing that has happened to humanity since the discovery of the wheel or fire.
This way we will be able to sustain the population in, say, Europe where the rate of natural human growth is almost negative.
We all know that the better the people live, the less they want to make babies.
I can understand why infertile couples would want to clone to have a child but I think it is wrong to clone a lost child whether they died through accident or disease.
You can never replace a child and trying to is just blinding yourself to the fact they are gone.
Human existence is reliant on genetic diversity - survival of the fittest - and through cloning you are reducing this diversity and may well be producing a child with a disease which has not yet become apparent in the donor.
I feel deeply for the child whose life is about to be exploited in the name of science.
Right now, we do not understand enough about the creation of life to explore it in this way.
Technology has given us the ability to jump ahead in our ability to explore the world, but too often in neglecting the little steps between these quantum leaps, we do not earn the right to this new knowledge and create horrible mistakes.
The cloning of humans is inevitable now the technology is here.
As for the question of is it morally right to clone humans, I think we should ask ourselves if it is morally right not to do so when this procedure has the potential to increase the happiness of so many.
Is it wrong for a person to want a child with the same genes as them?
All the arguments against cloning are fundamentally religious, but their beliefs are not necessarily the beliefs of all.
As for the argument that we should not be "playing God", we have been doing it since we first invented medicine that cured disease.
That said, regulation should be imposed on cloning humans as this technology could have very severe consequences in the wrong hands, but I do not believe it should be banned altogether.
Clonaid's actions are completely selfish and immoral.
Their motives are financial and cannot be in the interests of the newborn baby.
It disgusts me that any scientist can be so preoccupied with their studies as to remove themselves from potential human suffering.
It reminds me of the terrible experiments that the Nazis performed on the Jews throughout the second world war.
Scientists believing that their work came before the sanctity of life.
There is no justification for it.
That man should so blatantly interfere in nature, and something that God has created is news that makes me not so much sick as fearful.
There is a thin line between advancements in science, and meddling with the secrets of Creation, and it is better that we maintain that line!
I think its highly plausible that the first publicised cloned baby has been produced.
It would be fanciful thinking given the advances that have been made in the last century , medically and technologically that the next logical step would be the production of super humans who would not fall ill, go hungry, and suffer from no fatigue.
This is what cloning really is about and woe betide those who possess neither the wherewithal , nor the means to have access to this inevitable step in bio-technology/engineering.
Evolution ends today and religion will soon be fairytale.
Natural selection is taking too long and it is consuming too many casualties.
The future is now in the hand of man.
If would-be parents cannot have children, let them clone.
Why not?
I find the claim of a successful human cloning to be deeply disturbing.
Even more troubling, is the ultimate aim of the so-called Raelians, eternal life for humans.
Does he really think that we are the stuff that gods are made of?
I think this cheapens the short life we are given.
Just because of people's fear of death the whole of humanity has to suffer.
Like a clumsy child with money, they go about trying to dictate to the rest of the world what would solve humanity's only certainty.
It's not death that's the problem it's lack of happiness and compassion within life.
I'm 22 years old and feel my future (if I am blessed) my children's future and my loved ones, have only got fear to look forward to.
I don't want to be "like gods", I want to be able to love and be loved in a true sense.
I feel physically sick when I read things such as these.
I think it is not ethical to do human cloning.
The entire world through UN should ban this practice.
I think that if cloning can increase our life expectancy or provide better treatments for our sick and crippled then we should use the technology.
How many of these bleeding heart conservatives would change their point of view if they were struck down like Christopher Reeve (aka Superman) by a tragic accident that left them as a quadriplegic?
Or if their own son or daughter was totally crippled by some awful disease?
Further, if would-be parents cannot have children, let them clone.
Why not?
I think it's a total violation of the sanctity of human life and the whole concept of procreation.
It also takes away the wonderful uniqueness and individuality of every person.
Such developments add to the already prevalent and fast developing phenomenon of the throw-away world we seem to be living in.
It demotes and de-values human life.
The concept has absolutely no function thus its discovery need not even be pursued.
It clearly crosses the boundaries into the world of mindless curiosity, which if pursued leads to unbecoming results.
Basically, I think it's sick and a threat to my individuality and also the race (human race) I belong to.
It should be banned.
Those people may be less crazy than they pretend.
We don't know if they are good at science but we know for sure they are very good at PR.
As for cloning itself: sooner or later someone will do it, regardless of bans.
I'm fully pro cloning in a secure environment.
Ethical reasons should be claimed to stop the starvation and death of thousands of children around the globe.
Cloning of humans should be banned!
It is unethical. ridiculous and stupid.
Spare a thought for the feelings of the cloned child and the discrimination he will face, whose birth certificate has no father but the word "cloned".
Think of the consequences that runs so deep that no-one can possibly imagine.
Cloning should never be allowed.
I think that the idea of cloning a human is sick.
I can understand the desire to clone stem cells so we can produce organs and other vital parts of our own bodies but to create humans bypasses god's work in terms of sexual reproduction.
If something is not done to stop this they will not create life but will destroy life!!!
I'm surprised it took this long.
Honestly I believe that it was already done earlier except that its made public now.
It is not such an impossible claim.
This is an inevitable path for mankind to follow after mapping the genetic code as its only logical path.
However the use of this procedure in the hands of an elite group of people in any particular race is very dangerous.
The impact can be too far reaching down the line.
Hope something is being done about this.
These claims are very doubtful!
DNA testing of the mother and newborn will separate the truth from publicity mania.
I say this cloning affair is exciting!
Hopefully, it will stir up major international debates about ethics and science.
The back-and-forth of whether Iraq has weapons was getting rather boring!
Science has already created a lot of unintended bad effects on the nature and we must get rid of it.
Cloning on human beings, as I understand with layman's knowledge, would definitely cause harms to uniqueness of individuals and it might be disastrous at the end of the day.
I think it is very unethical and can lead to disastrous consequences.
There should be a universal ban on human cloning.
We should not mess with the art of creating ourselves.
The idea of cloning humans is deeply disturbing.
We should focus more on the opposite of cloning; "individualising." to take part in our programme.

ET MIAMI (Reuters) - The head of a company that says it has produced the first human clone said on Monday that the mother and baby were home following the child's birth last week and genetic proof demanded by scientists and other skeptics should be available in a week.

Cloned baby back home in US on Monday: cult-member scientist
WASHINGTON, Dec. 29 (Xinhuanet) -- The cult-member French scientist who claimed to have produced the world's first cloned human said the baby girl, called Eve, was flying home to the United States on Monday, The Associated Press has reported.
Brigitte Boisselier, a former French research chemist belonging to Raelians, a religious group which believes first humans on Earth were created 25,000 years ago by extra-terrestrials who cloned themselves, said the baby would return to home with her family.
Boisselier declined to reveal further details of where the baby was born and to which US city the mother and the girl would travel, saying keeping secrecy was necessary to protect the child and the family.
She stunned the world last Friday by announcing that Eve, a 3.13-kilogram baby girl, was cloned from skin cells taken from a 31-year-old US woman.
At the press conference announcing the birth of "Eve" in Florida, the United States, Boisselier provided no scientific evidence or any picture of the mother and the child.
Many scientists are skeptical of the claim, which has provoked worldwide condemnation, and some even doubt the existence of Eve.
Boisselier's cult background increases the skepticism of mainstream scientists.

Clone-coming queen.
The baby girl touted as the world's first human clone is coming to America.
Clonaid, the cult-linked biotech company that announced last week it had created the child, said yesterday that she'll arrive at her home in an unidentified U.S. city today.
Clonaid CEO Brigitte Boisselier said the arrival of the baby girl - nicknamed "Eve," for obvious reasons - will put to rest the skepticism that greeted Friday's announcement of the birth.
"Once  the baby is  at home it is possible for an independent expert to go there, and once a sample is taken we will see" that she is a clone, Boisselier said, referring to DNA testing that will be overseen by a former ABC News science editor.
"Perhaps by the end of the week or early next week we should have all the details," Boisselier said.
She has so far refused to provide any scientific proof of the cloning or reveal where the healthy, 7-pound child was born.
Clonaid is linked to a religious sect called the Raelians, who believe that space aliens launched life on Earth by cloning themselves.
Last week's announcement set off an outcry worldwide - and angered lawmakers on both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue.
The White House immediately condemned the alleged cloning and yesterday, Sen.
Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) called upon Congress to ban the procedure.
"I think it was a kind of earthquake, if you will, because I think it brought to the fore that there's no real safeguards," Feinstein said on "Fox News Sunday."
Feinstein's bill would punish violators with 10-year prison sentences and $1 million fines - but would allow some cloning for medical research.
The United States has no law against cloning.
But the Food and Drug Administration forbids human cloning without prior permission.
It is investigating whether Clonaid illegally performed any work on U.S. soil.

Prosecutors are trying to confirm testimony from Clonaid officials in Seoul that the company impregnated a South Korean woman with a cloned human embryo and that she left the country in July, local media reported Tuesday.
The testimony came during questioning of officials at the South Korean office of Clonaid, a U.S.-based religious sect that claimed last week it had produced the world's first cloned baby, national Yonhap news agency quoted unnamed prosecution officials as saying Monday.
In addition to the cloned baby the group claims has already been delivered, Clonaid has said that four other women including two from Asia are expected to give birth to clones by early February.
Reports here have speculated that the South Korean is one of these women.
There has been no independent confirmation of the group's cloning claims and many experts have expressed skepticism.
Officials did not say what country the South Korean woman was thought to have gone to.
Clonaid said Sunday that the cloned baby, allegedly born to an American woman, and her family were going to return to the United States Monday, but where they live and further details were not released.
Clonaid officials in the United States did not answer phone messages and e-mails Monday from The Associated Press.
In Seoul, South Korean prosecutors had opened an investigation in July after the sect's local office said a Korean woman had been successfully impregnated with the cloned embryo with help from BioFusion Tech, a firm based in the southeastern city of Daegu.
Expanding their investigation, prosecution investigators have recently seized documents and other research data from BioFusion and questioned its officials, Yonhap said.
Investigators confirmed that three Korean women applied to have cloned human embryos implanted and located one of them, a former model identified only by her surname Kim, it said.
They said Kim testified that she applied for the cloning test but had never been implanted with a cloned embryo, it said.
Prosecution officials refused to comment on the report.
The prosecution probe has focused on whether the companies violated existing laws that ban unlicensed, unethical medical activities or practices.
South Korea has no law banning human cloning yet, but has been accelerating efforts to enact its first law against human cloning since the investigations began in July.
The Science and Technology Ministry has drafted a bill that calls for a prison term of up to 10 years for those who attempt or help to clone humans.
Research on embryonic stem cells could revolutionize the treatment of diseases such as cancer and Parkinson's disease.
But the research is controversial because embryos must be destroyed to recover the stem cells.
Clonaid was founded in 1997 by the Raelian Movement, a sect that believes life on earth was created by clones of extraterrestrials.
Little else is known about the group.
On Monday, a top Clonaid official said the company was founded in the Bahamas, but its presence there was limited to a post office box for receiving correspondence.
Speaking by telephone from Las Vegas, Clonaid Vice President Thomas Kaenzig said the group's main concern was the safety of its patients and staff.
"We don't want to risk anybody's life," he said.

Alleged Clone Coming To America   December 30, 2002 10:54:23
NEW YORK, Dec. 30, 2002 Boisselier said a pediatrician has seen the baby and that the child is "doing fine."
She also said a second cloned baby is due to be born next week to a lesbian couple in northern Europe.
Brigitte Boisselier, a chemist at Clonaid, announcing the claim of an historic discovery.
(AP) A company called Clonaid claims to have cloned the first human being and says the baby named Eve is coming to America Monday with her family.
The baby is flying into the U.S. with her family Monday, Brigitte Boisselier said, two days after she announced the child's birth.
Boisselier is chief executive of Clonaid, the cloning company affiliated with the Raelians, a religious sect that believes space aliens launched life on Earth.
"I think it's a big step for human beings in the future.
It will bring us eternal life.
That's the best thing that can happen to humanity.
We can not only cure all diseases but also it will give us eternal life,  said Claude Vorilhon on The former French journalist founded Clonaid and is the leader of a sect called the Raelians.
Vorilhon, who calls himself Rael, claims a space alien visiting him in 1973 revealed that extraterrestrials had created all life on Earth through genetic engineering.
Boisselier, who claims two chemistry degrees, identifies herself as a Raelian "bishop" and said Clonaid retains philosophical but not economic links to the Raelians.
So far there has been no independent confirmation of the possible breakthrough.
Boisselier offered no scientific proof, provided no photographs and did not produce the child or the mother, who she said is a 31-year-old with an infertile husband.
Her announcement was met with doubt by the scientific community and revulsion by many ethicists.
I don't believe that this group has the scientific expertise, the know-how to bring this off.
The best cloners in the world are in veterinary medicine.
They make it work in about 1 in 400 times,  said Art Caplan, director of the Department of Medical Ethics at the University of Pennsylvania.
"If you looked at the outcomes of cloning in animals, one half of the animals that have been cloned, pigs, sheep, cows, are dead within a year, and of the survivors, almost all of them have health problems.
Dolly the sheep has arthritis, and seizures, and growth disorders, and immune diseases.
What I'm ashamed of is that someone could come on TV and say yes well we're going to have eternal life.
I think cloning right now, as we understand it, is the road to eternal sickness,  he added.
To gain convincing proof that "Eve" is a clone, Boisselier said she had accepted an offer by a former ABC News science editor who has chosen independent experts to draw DNA from the mother and the newborn and test them for a match.
"The baby is going home and once at home it is possible for an independent expert to go there and once a sample is taken we will see," Boisselier said on Sunday, referring to DNA testing needed to prove whether the child is really a clone.
"On Monday if a sample is taken, perhaps by the end of the week or early next week we should have all the details."
Boisselier previously said the child's mother is American but has offered no further details.
On Sunday, neither she nor Clonaid spokeswoman Nadine Gary would say where in the United States the mother is from, where the child was born or what U.S. city they would be arriving in.
Both said details were being kept secret to protect the child and its family.
Boisselier's comments Sunday came two days after she announced at a Florida news conference that Clonaid scientists had produced the world's first cloned baby.
She said "Eve," a healthy 7-pound girl, was delivered by Caesarean section Thursday and is an exact genetic copy of her mother.
Boisselier said a pediatrician has seen the baby and that the child is "doing fine."
She also said a second cloned baby is due to be born next week to a lesbian couple in northern Europe.
Boisselier had previously announced that four other couples, including the lesbians, were expected to give birth to Clonaid-created clones by early February.
The United States has no specific law against human cloning.
But the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration, which regulates human experiments, says its regulations forbid human cloning without prior agency permission, and it has launched an investigation into whether Clonaid illegally performed any work on U.S. soil.

The company 'Clonaid' claims to have cloned the first human and is affiliated with the religious sect Raelians, the group's spiritual leader Rael discusses baby 'Eve,' on 'The Early Show.'
Doubts surrounding the clone claim continue to multiply, as skeptics attack Clonaid s credibility and question its affiliation with a religious cult called Raelians, Randall Pinkston reports.

Clonaid: Baby 'clone' to return home Monday
Brigitte Boisselier announced Friday that a cloned baby had been born.
CNN's Sanjay Gupta reports on the disbelief, alarm greeting cloning claim.
The old Hebrew phrase "Elohim" -- usually translated as a name for God -- should have been interpreted as a reference to non-Earthlings "from the sky."
These entities are, Raelians say, responsible for the creation of life on Earth.
The organization says it comprises some 40,000 members worldwide, with highest concentrations in France, Canada and Japan.
Outside researchers have suggested the membership may be smaller.
A company founded by members of a sect that believes mankind was created by extraterrestrials says the alleged first human clone -- an infant girl -- will return home Monday and will undergo testing to verify its genetic makeup.
An independent expert will take cell samples from the mother and girl, dubbed "Eve," this week and conduct tests to prove they are genetic duplicates, said Brigitte Boisselier, CEO of Clonaid.
The company says its scientists produced the child.
Clonaid was founded by the Raelians, a religious sect that believes extraterrestrials created life on Earth through genetic engineering.
Boisselier is a bishop in the movement, led by former French journalist Claude Vorilhon, who now calls himself "Rael."
Rael said Monday that the baby is "perfectly healthy," and defended the company against human cloning critics.
"I think opponents to cloning are more afraid of a healthy baby than of a handicapped child," he said.
"They would be so happy the child will be handicapped, saying, 'Look, this is terrible, they are creating handicapped children.'
Their most utmost fear is to have a healthy, smiling baby, because then the public opinion will change completely and everybody will say, 'That's beautiful.' " ( Citing privacy concerns, Boisselier would not say where home is for the 7-pound baby, which she said was born Thursday.
She has already said the mother is a 31-year-old American citizen.
"I hope that I can disclose everything soon," Boisselier said.
The expert who will conduct the tests won't be identified until after they are conducted "so that he won't be followed to the place where the parents are living," Boisselier said.
The expert was selected by ABC's science correspondent Michael Guillen, who suggested the company allow someone on the outside to verify the process.
The parents must be the ones to decide whether others can then test the baby to confirm the results, Boisselier said.
The announcement has been met with fierce criticism, mainly because other cloned mammals have had serious birth defects or have developed health problems later.
"I think it is an act of medical malpractice to do human reproductive cloning when animal data shows how risky it is -- how high the frequency is of miscarriage, birth defects and even life problems with other species," University of Wisconsin bioethicist Alta Charo said.
"We've been unsuccessful at doing this in our closest animal relatives."
Robert Lanza, a researcher with Advanced Cell Technologies, a private Massachusetts-based genetic research firm, said Clonaid has "absolutely no scientific track record."
"We are, of course, extremely concerned that if this did, in fact, happen, that there is going to be a tremendous public outcry, and we will be concerned with what the Congress does," Lanza said.
"Obviously, we are concerned about there being a backlash against the medical applications of this technology, which have, of course, the potential to cure millions of patients."
She said revealing such evidence might reveal the "trick" behind human cloning.
In January, she said, Clonaid is planning 20 more implantations of human clones.
At that time, an independent expert may attend the process so he can see the sampling, the growing embryos, and the implantation.
"That's the least I can do, but I cannot spread all my notes," she said.
Eve was allegedly the first baby born of 10 implantations Clonaid did this year.
Five of the implantations failed.
The second cloned baby will be born next week, Boisselier said.
"So far, really, there are no indications of any problems, and I do believe that this  second baby  will be like Eve -- no problems," she said.
When asked about the imperfect results of animal cloning, Boisselier said Clonaid's procedure cannot be compared.
The problems with animal cloning are a result of the specific procedures those scientists have used to reproduce the animals, and not the cloning process itself.
"We are serious people, responsible people, dealing with human beings," she said.
"We are offering to some parents the right and the choice to have a child with their own genes."
And if, in the process of cloning, Clonaid's scientists should detect deformities or abnormalities in the child, the fetus will be aborted.
"But from what we've seen, there have been no such things," Boisselier said.
"There have been early miscarriages like in IVF  in vitro fertilization , but no problems, no defects during the pregnancy." 3 U.S. humanitarian workers shot dead N.
