[1]  MIAMI (Reuters) - The head of a company that says it has produced the first human clone said on Monday that the mother and baby were home following the child's birth last week and genetic proof demanded by scientists and other skeptics should be available in a week.
[2]  Brigitte Boisselier, chief executive of Clonaid, which is linked to a group that believes mankind was created by extraterrestrials, declined to say whether the 31-year-old American mother and her child were in the United States or elsewhere.
[3]  Her claim to have cloned a human being drew skeptical reaction from experts in the field and she offered no proof, but told Reuters that genetic testing was scheduled for Tuesday.
[4]  Boisselier announced on Friday in Florida that the company had produced the first human clone with the birth of a 7-pound baby girl called Eve.
[5]  Clonaid was founded by the creator of the Raelian Movement, a group that claims 55,000 followers around the world and asserts that life on Earth was sparked by extraterrestrials who arrived 25,000 years ago and created humans through cloning.
[6]  The testimony came during questioning of officials at the South Korean office of Clonaid, a U.S.-based religious sect that claimed last week it had produced the world's first cloned baby, national Yonhap news agency quoted unnamed prosecution officials as saying Monday.
[7]  Clonaid had said four other couples including two from Asia are expected to give birth to clones by early February, in addition to the American woman they said had already given birth to the cloned baby called Eve.
[8]  Clonaid said Sunday that the cloned baby Eve and her family were going to return home to the United States Monday, but where they live and further details were not released.
[9]  They said Lee testified that she applied for the cloning test but had never been implanted with a cloned embryo, it said.
[10]  South Korea has no law banning human cloning yet, but has been accelerating efforts to enact its first law against human cloning since the investigations began in July.
[11]  Most cloning experts are opposed to cloning for reproductive purposes, citing numerous birth defects and other serious problems affecting cloned animals.
[12]  The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has launched an investigation into claims by a US-based company, Clonaid, that it has created the first-ever cloned human baby.
[13]  The FDA - which regulates human trials in the US - says it is looking into the allegations even though the company said the cloning had occurred outside the country.
[14]  Clonaid, which is linked to a sect that believes aliens created humans by cloning, said on Friday that it had produced a human clone and that four more would be born soon.
[15]  The claim has met with deep scepticism among scientists, and has led to renewed calls by world leaders to ban human cloning.
[16]  "We want to check and see first whether the cloning did take place, and second if it violated any of our laws," FDA spokesman Brad Stone said.
[17]  Clonaid scientist Brigitte Boisselier said the first human clone - a girl nicknamed Eve - was born on Thursday to an American mother.
[18]  Prosecutors in South Korea have seized documents from a biotechnology company linked to a controversial sect which claims to have created the world's first cloned baby.
[19]  After raiding the offices of BioFusion Tech Inc. in the southern city of Daegu, officials questioned members of staff to see whether they had taken part in the cloning project.
[20]  Last week, scientists from Clonaid - a US-based firm linked to the Raelian sect - said that they had helped a woman give birth to a cloned baby girl.
[21]  As a US company with links to a religious sect claims to have cloned the first human baby, politicians and scientists are calling for the process to be outlawed.
[22]  The scientist leading Clonaid's efforts, Dr Brigitte Boisselier, said she was "celebrating a scientific success" after the birth of a girl called Eve on Boxing Day.
[23]  But US President George W Bush called on Congress to outlaw human cloning and French President Jacques Chirac said the development was "criminal and contrary to human dignity".
[24]  I don't have a problem with cloning on a philosophical level, but I think it is cruel to experiment genetically with human beings.
[25]  Any ban on cloning will foster illegal cloning and cloning research in countries that do not have or enforce such a ban.
[26]  Cloned baby back home in US on Monday: cult-member scientist
[27]  WASHINGTON, Dec. 29 (Xinhuanet) -- The cult-member French scientist who claimed to have produced the world's first cloned human said the baby girl, called Eve, was flying home to the United States on Monday, The Associated Press has reported.
[28]  Brigitte Boisselier, a former French research chemist belonging to Raelians, a religious group which believes first humans on Earth were created 25,000 years ago by extra-terrestrials who cloned themselves, said the baby would return to home with her family.
[29]  Boisselier declined to reveal further details of where the baby was born and to which US city the mother and the girl would travel, saying keeping secrecy was necessary to protect the child and the family.
[30]  Clonaid, the cult-linked biotech company that announced last week it had created the child, said yesterday that she'll arrive at her home in an unidentified U.S. city today.
[31]  "Once  the baby is  at home it is possible for an independent expert to go there, and once a sample is taken we will see" that she is a clone, Boisselier said, referring to DNA testing that will be overseen by a former ABC News science editor.
[32]  Clonaid is linked to a religious sect called the Raelians, who believe that space aliens launched life on Earth by cloning themselves.
[33]  Alleged Clone Coming To America   December 30, 2002 10:54:23
[34]  NEW YORK, Dec. 30, 2002 Boisselier said a pediatrician has seen the baby and that the child is "doing fine."
[35]  She also said a second cloned baby is due to be born next week to a lesbian couple in northern Europe.
[36]  (AP) A company called Clonaid claims to have cloned the first human being and says the baby named Eve is coming to America Monday with her family.
[37]  The baby is flying into the U.S. with her family Monday, Brigitte Boisselier said, two days after she announced the child's birth.
[38]  Boisselier is chief executive of Clonaid, the cloning company affiliated with the Raelians, a religious sect that believes space aliens launched life on Earth.
[39]  Food and Drug Administration, which regulates human experiments, says its regulations forbid human cloning without prior agency permission, and it has launched an investigation into whether Clonaid illegally performed any work on U.S. soil.
[40]  Brigitte Boisselier announced Friday that a cloned baby had been born.
[41]  CNN's Sanjay Gupta reports on the disbelief, alarm greeting cloning claim.
[42]  A company founded by members of a sect that believes mankind was created by extraterrestrials says the alleged first human clone -- an infant girl -- will return home Monday and will undergo testing to verify its genetic makeup.
[43]  Rael said Monday that the baby is "perfectly healthy," and defended the company against human cloning critics.
[44]  "I think it is an act of medical malpractice to do human reproductive cloning when animal data shows how risky it is -- how high the frequency is of miscarriage, birth defects and even life problems with other species," University of Wisconsin bioethicist Alta Charo said.
[45]  The problems with animal cloning are a result of the specific procedures those scientists have used to reproduce the animals, and not the cloning process itself.
[46]  Prosecutors are trying to confirm testimony from Clonaid officials in Seoul that the company impregnated a South Korean woman with a cloned human embryo and that she left the country in July, local media reported Tuesday.
[47]  In addition to the cloned baby the group claims has already been delivered, Clonaid has said that four other women including two from Asia are expected to give birth to clones by early February.
[48]  Clonaid said Sunday that the cloned baby, allegedly born to an American woman, and her family were going to return to the United States Monday, but where they live and further details were not released.
[49]  They said Kim testified that she applied for the cloning test but had never been implanted with a cloned embryo, it said.
