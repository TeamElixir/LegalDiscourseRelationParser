[66]  Bollinger) The Supreme Court struck down a point system used by the University of Michigan to give minorities preference in undergraduate admissions.
[67]  The court, however, approved a separate program used by the University of Michigan's law school that gives race less prominence in the admissions decision-making process.

[71]  The court ruled that the law school's affirmative action policy, which considers race as a factor in admissions but does not assign specific weight to it, does not violate the equal protections clause of the 14th Amendment, while the undergraduate policy does.
[72]  Supreme Court on Monday upheld a controversial  ) law school, but struck down a plan used by the undergraduate school that gave certain racial groups a head start in admissions.

[77]  June 23 -- A divided Supreme Court has upheld a University of Michigan law school admissions policy that gives minorities an edge.
[78]  Supreme Court on Monday upheld a University of Michigan law school policy that gives minority applicants an edge, but the justices overturned an undergraduate program that automatically awarded members of certain minorities 20 points toward the 100 needed for admission.
[79]  THE COURT made it clear that the reason it upheld the law school admission policy while rejecting the undergraduate policy was that the law school gave what Justice Sandra Day O Connor called  meaningful individualized review  to each applicant.

[81]  We will read the decisions very carefully and start working with our admissions people to make sure that our undergraduate  admissions  process will pass the court s muster,  Coleman told reporters who gathered on the steps of the Supreme Court building.
[82]  They have basically said the law school s procedures are constitutional.    ... every school that wants to use race in their admissions and stay within the Constitution, as now interpreted by the Supreme Court, will mimic the process used by the University of Michigan ...
[83]  The law school did not use an automatic bonus point system for minority applicants but did have a race-conscious policy of assessing applicant in order to see if they d contribute to student-body diversity.
[84]  She also seemed to set a deadline for the school:  We take the law school at its word that it would  like nothing better than to find a race-neutral admissions formula  and will terminate its race-conscious admissions program as soon as practicable....
[85]  The problem with the Court s opinion is that it does not really identify what racial diversity is, so it is difficult to know when it will have been achieved sufficiently to justify ending the use of race in admissions.
[86]  The two Michigan cases were the most significant tests of racial preferences to reach the court since the 1978 Bakke decision, in which the court held that race could be used as one factor among many others in making college admission decisions.
[87]  The (Constitution s) Equal Protection Clause does not prohibit the law school s narrowly tailored use of race in admissions decisions to further a compelling interest in obtaining the educational benefits that flow from a diverse student body,  O Connor wrote.
[88]  In the case involving the university s undergraduate admissions, the high court said the bonus points that the school automatically awarded to all black, Latino and American Indian applicants was too rigid and heavy-handed a use of race.
