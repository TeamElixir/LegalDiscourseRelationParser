Businesses Hail Affirmative Action Ruling
Search the Web and ABCNEWS.com   Several large corporations generally applauded the Supreme Court's mixed rulings Monday on the University of Michigan's affirmative action policies, saying anything that promotes a more diverse work place is good for business.
In two varying decisions, the high court ruled that minority applicants can receive some preference when applying for admission to universities, but justices limited how much of a factor race can play in student selection.
The court struck down a point system used by the University of Michigan for minority preferences but OK'd a separate program used at the college's law school that gives race less prominence in the admissions process.
Dozens of big companies had backed the University of Michigan, saying such programs help produce better workers of all races and ethnic backgrounds.
"General Motors' position has consistently been that diversity of background, thought and experience is essential to the education process," said Rod Gillum, vice president for corporate responsibility and diversity at Detroit-based GM, the world's largest automaker.
"Efforts by universities to create a diverse student body from which corporations can recruit should be supported," Gillum said.
Microsoft, American Airlines, Procter   Gamble, Eastman Kodak and PepsiCo were among more than 40 Fortune 500 companies siding with the University of Michigan.
Chuck Mulloy, spokesman for Santa Clara, Calif.-based Intel Corp., said the chip-making giant didn't take a specific position on Michigan's policies but was gratified the court ruled that race should be among the factors considered for admissions.
"We're in a sector that has a high requirement for advanced science and math education programs, and anything that enlarges the pool of talent in that area is good for companies like Intel," Mulloy said.
The Michigan case was the most significant affirmative action case to reach the court in decades.
At issue was whether racial preference programs unconstitutionally discriminated against white students.
Like many companies, New York-based Pfizer Corp. filed a friend-of-the-court brief in the case supporting affirmative action, said spokesman Bryant Haskins.
"We're pleased the court considered the views of companies like ours in making its decision," Haskins said.
The Bush administration filed its own brief in the case in January, arguing that admissions systems at the undergraduate school and law school are unconstitutional.
However, the administration disappointed some conservatives when it stopped short of challenging any use of race in university selection or in other government decisions.
Martin Castro, a University of Michigan law school graduate and partner with the Chicago firm Seyfarth Shaw, said he's convinced the number of amicus briefs filed by big business on behalf of the school had an influence on the court.
Castro, who called himself a "product of affirmative action" at Michigan, said many Fortune 1000 companies have signed pledges to use law firms with ample minority representation.
"I think corporate America's commitment to diversity has influenced the legal profession to become even more committed to diversity," he said.
Businesses were not alone in backing the university's policies.
The United Auto Workers union said it filed a brief supporting the admissions policies in 2001 when the matter was before the 6th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals.
"Although we're disappointed the (high) court did not uphold Michigan's undergraduate admissions system as well, we're pleased the court provided ... a 'road map' for using affirmative action in a sensitive, individualized way to promote diversity in its undergraduate student body," said UAW President Ron Gettelfinger.
Mary Sue Coleman, president of the University of Michigan, walks past the Supreme Court after the ruling on the use of affirmative action in college admissions Monday, June 23, 2003 in Washington.
In two split decisions, the Supreme Court on Monday ruled that minority applicants may be given an edge when applying for admissions to universities, but limited how much a factor race can play in the selection of students.

Supreme Court Upholds Affirmative Action
Search the Web and ABCNEWS.com   A majority of the Supreme Court said together what just one justice said 25 years ago: A diverse college campus population benefits all students and society at large, and colleges may pick their students based in part on race.
By a 5-4 vote on Monday, the high court upheld the concept of affirmative action at public universities, a ruling that is expected to have a wide ripple effect through other public and private institutions.
In decisions involving the University of Michigan, the majority ruled that race can be one of the factors that colleges use to pick their students, so long as it is not the only factor.
The ruling said government has an interest in ensuring a better shot for minorities at getting into top-notch colleges.
"Universities cannot establish quotas for members of certain racial groups or put members of those groups on different admission tracks," Justice Sandra Day O'Connor wrote for the majority in the more significant of two affirmative action rulings.
"Universities can, however, consider race or ethnicity more flexibly as a 'plus' factor in the context of individualized consideration of each and every applicant."
That essentially preserves the status quo for university admissions officers, but strengthens the legal and constitutional standing of race-conscious admissions policies.
It also echoes nearly verbatim the language of the late Justice Lewis F.
Powell in the court's landmark 1978 Bakke v.
California ruling.
In Bakke, a different set of justices struck down racial quotas.
Powell wrote separately in that case to say that race could be an "plus factor" that gives a minority candidate a subtle boost in competition with white applicants.
Because of the way the court fractured in Bakke, Powell's solo opinion has been treated as the controlling ruling, although opponents of affirmative action often disputed its importance.
The court also struck down a more rigid point-based screening system used to weed out applicants at Michigan's undergraduate campus.
That vote was 6-3 with O'Connor again in the majority.
The undergraduate system at Michigan awarded 20 points to minorities out of a possible 150, greater weight than was given to some measures of academic excellence or other attributes.
University President Mary Sue Coleman said the school will replace its undergraduate admissions system with another that factors in race.
Like most other public and private universities, Michigan had tried to devise admissions systems that complied with the court's 1978 ruling, but it was not clear until now whether they had succeeded.
The nation's college administrators called the latest rulings a victory that will allow them to keep admissions policies largely intact.
"The decisions uphold the principle that colleges have the right to not only use their own discretion, but that there is a compelling interest to making sure diversity is there," said Cheryl Fields, a spokeswoman for the National Association of State Universities and Land-Grant Colleges, which represents 211 schools.
"Based on that, I think most universities will not have to make sweeping changes in what they're doing," she said.
The Bakke ruling has been widely seen as messy and murky, and lower federal courts have split over how to interpret the Powell holding.
The Supreme Court revisited the issue in part to settle the question of whether Powell was right a generation ago.
The majority said he was.
"It has been 25 years since Justice Powell first approved the use of race to further an interest in student body diversity in the context of public higher education," O'Connor wrote.
"Since that time the number of minority applicants with high grades and test scores has indeed increased.
We expect that 25 years from now, the use of racial preferences will no longer be necessary to further the interest approved today."
Opponents of affirmative action had hoped the Supreme Court would use this opportunity to ban most consideration of race in any government decisions.
The court is far more conservative than in 1978, and the justices have put heavy conditions on government affirmative action in other arenas over the past decade.
O'Connor, a friend and admirer of Powell's, quotes from him extensively in her majority opinion.
Like Powell, she is a moderate conservative and often the court's deciding vote in close cases.
Justices John Paul Stevens, David Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer joined her endorsement of a program in place at the University of Michigan's law school.
The law school uses an inexact admissions formula that gives extra consideration to blacks, Hispanics and American Indians, groups the school says have historically suffered from discrimination.
The program has produced minority enrollment of between 12 percent and 20 percent over the past decade.
There is no fixed target, the school said.
The cases put the Bush administration in an awkward spot.
The White House had sided with white applicants rejected at the Michigan schools without endorsing an outright end to affirmative action.
"There are innovative and proven ways for colleges and universities to reflect our diversity without using racial quotas," President Bush said Monday.
"The court has made clear that colleges and universities must engage in a serious, good faith consideration of workable race-neutral alternatives."
In the end, the high court made only bare mention of the administration's argument that race-neutral alternatives to affirmative action are already working in Bush's home state of Texas and elsewhere.
The law school case is Grutter v.
Bollinger, 02-241; the undergraduate case is Gratz v.
Bollinger, 02-516.

BBC NEWS   Have Your Say   Should universities ban affirmative action?
The American Supreme Court has ruled that universities can take racial background into account when admitting new students.
However, the court has stopped the University of Michigan from giving black and Hispanic applicants extra points towards admission - saying that the policy was too broad to be constitutional.
The rulings centred on a case brought by three white students whose applications for places at the university - one of them in the graduate law school - were turned down.
Their case was backed by President George Bush, who called the Michigan admission plan "divisive, unfair, and impossible to square with the US Constitution."
No I don't believe we should ban affirmative action.
And my reasoning is quite simple, when we allow others points for admissions, whether it be sports, academic, or alumni.
I was really surprised that our dear President, for all his concern of fairness, was not in favour of abolishing the whole point system for everyone.
But since he has benefited himself, from his college days.(George Bush Sr.
Yale University Alumni) Not by race of course.
Personally I think all appointments and considerations for any position should be done on merit.
We all need to strive for a non racial non sexist society.
It is also up to the people who are making the decisions that need to be trained to strive for this.
Believe it or not, the black students in question are generally part of the same culture as the white students.
Anglo-American culture permeates all ethnic groups within one or two generations, regardless of their original backgrounds.
So unless we are to believe that people's ancestors should earn them extra credit in school, affirmative action is a ridiculous idea.
Since a higher proportion of people from Chinese and Japanese backgrounds get into universities should white students be given a slight advantage over these groups when applying?
Also, where in Europe does one draw the line seeking to establish if a 'white' person is 'Hispanic' or 'pure white'?
Attempts to correct imbalances in opportunity owing to birth and background are laudable, but to make race the criteria is crude, inaccurate and divisive.
Affirmative action is no different than other forms of racial and sexual discrimination.
I teach in Chicago,IL and most of my students are Latino, South Asian, and African American.
They are dedicated, responsible, smart, and study very hard.
Affirmative Action is necessary for diversity in our universities, work places, and government, as well as to prevent a major racial civil war in the United States.
An affirmative action program based on purely socio-economic criteria is certainly the best solution.
An overwhelming majority of "minorities" (as opposed to whites) will be represented if this is implemented, as poor and lower class whites generally have the least bit interest in attending college, and prefer trades, etc..
Also, there would be much less of a stigma unfairly attached to the legitimately qualified "minority" students.
I have graduated from University of Michigan and still live in Ann Arbor.
All I have to say is that when an institution creates an environment meant to help people of a specific colour skin, it makes it worse for those people.
Because once they are in the institution that they did not work to get into, people assume they are not qualified to be there based on the colour of their skin.
Racism does not cure Racism.
I am sick and tired of people defining fair as "only if you're a minority".
The days of affirmative action are long over and it really should be abolished.
This country has always had a problem with racial issues and in an attempt to prove the words of our Constitution,   8220;All men are created equal  8221;, was not simply a pipe dream of the founding fathers, they pushed affirmative action.
Its impact and importance cannot be stressed strongly enough and it was a valid avenue to force segregated institutions to integrate, but what has occurred in the intervening years is reverse discrimination.
Why should I as a white woman be penalized simply because of the colour of my skin?
Entry into college should always be based on merit, not race, colour or creed.
No ban on Affirmative Action.
We are barely 40 years past LEGISLATED voting rights protections in this country.
Even though Brown v.
Board of Education (permitting equal access to education) was 50 years ago, many desegregation efforts continue today.
The idea that powerful racist, separatist individuals no longer exist to block people of colour from access to education is a myth.
Until they die off, we need Affirmative Action.
I come from a middle sized, white, Christian, conservative town nicknamed "The Bubble".
I can think of two Jewish families and one Muslim family that live in my town, but other cultures were never talked about in my town simply because they weren't around.
Two years ago I was accepted into the University of Michigan- what a world of a difference!
I'm a Near Eastern Studies major, and what I have learned in the past two years simply cannot be found without Ann Arbour's student body.
Granted, would I still support affirmative action if I hadn't gotten in?
Probably not.
But, this is my overall stance: affirmative action isn't fair to everyone, but it's more fair than having no system at all.
When people say "money should be put towards Detroit's public schools, where the root of the problem is," I tell them to get real and think of a realistic solution.
There will always be horrible school districts, let's just try to do what we can where we can.
Any form of preferential treatment in modern society is wrong.
Affirmative action allows the liberals in America to "feel good" towards correcting the perceived sins of the past.
What is ironic is that it keeps those who benefit from the treatment in a cycle of segregation.
This country was created on diversity and we should embrace it and move forward without any special treatments.
Affirmative Action was put into place to address the socioeconomic inequities that have long plagued this country.
Were there perfect equality of opportunity in America, then there would be absolutely no need whatsoever for Affirmative Action.
The problem is essentially that minorities achieved legal equality only in 1967 with the passage of the Civil Rights Amendment.
Current university-age persons are therefore only about two generations removed from a period in which inequality in schools, social benefits, and voting rights were the norm.
Perhaps affirmative action should be less focused on race than on economic wellbeing.
Maybe this would be the way to square the circle.
It may not, however, end the perception that certain segments of the population are given preferential treatment due to race.
This is a problem with no simple solution.
I feel that by still acknowledging diversity, racism will persist.
Enough with the forms asking what race/colour you are, by acknowledging race as a factor in anything, you are further perpetuating racism.
I support affirmative action, but one has to wonder why a rich black student who attended the best schools would get "extra points" while a poor white student from an inferior school would not.
There is a real and measurable difference between white and black household incomes in the US.
Affirmative Action addresses this, which is a good thing, but it does not address the needs of poor white kids.
Who's looking out for them?
Perhaps affirmative action should be more income-based than race-based.
Although I am a Filipino American female, I believe affirmative action should be removed.
I am an engineer who rarely studied during college.
Most of my classmates were white males who studied extremely hard to receive good grades.
The fact is I would have an easier time getting into graduate school based merely on my ethnicity or my gender.
This is racism in every sense of the word.
I believe receiving benefits based on your racial background is wrong even though I am the one who benefits from it.
I know that it is receiving merit for something that is undeserved.
Affirmative action is racist and does nothing but stoke racial tensions in America.
Statistics show that the main beneficiaries of affirmative action are middle and upper class blacks and white women.
Why not simply change the consideration from race to socio-economic?
This is just politicking as usual.
I go to Columbia University, which is one of the seven Ivy League institutions in America, along with Harvard and Yale.
I can tell you from first hand experience the school has a large Asian-American representation.
This is true for most of America's major universities, including NYU, MIT, Harvard, Stanford and others.
However, I also know that this group is not helped by Affirmative Action because the government feels they are competitive without assistance, regardless of the fact that they were more discriminated that Hispanics (who might have blonde hair, blue eyes, who might be racially white, if not ethnically).
How is this correcting past discrimination, when it seems that it only discriminates against groups that have been successful?
Maybe if the government spent more money and resources in improving poor school districts then minority students would be competitive enough on their own merits to get into good schools.
There are rich black people and there are rich white people.
Just as there are poor black people and poor white people.
Therefore, affirmative action is indeed a mild form of racism.
I would much prefer a system where kids from poorer backgrounds are preferred.
I find it offensive that so many people in America and England truly believe that racism is dead.
As a white, middle-class male I know that no matter what quotas that help minorities are put into place, I will make it because I have been born into every advantage possible (except for maybe being rich).
I cannot say that for my non-white counterparts who routinely are turned down for housing loans, incarcerated at an alarming rate compared to whites, and given the poorer quality schools and tougher neighbourhoods to grow up with.
I agree affirmative action should only be temporary but it has been 200 years since the end of slavery and equality is still floating on the horizon.
Unless we address the real problems leading to inequality in the first place, we will continue to have these unnatural raw deals, leaving both sides incensed.
I believe that if Americans are to be seen as equals in each others eyes, religion, skin colour or economics aside, they must be measured by the same standard when it comes to education.
As long as any group of people insist on "extra points" it will be seen as their inability to measure up on their own.
I believe affirmative action has outlived it's day and now only serves to demean those it is supposed to assist.
I'm black, but I do not support affirmative action as we know it.
Perhaps I was somewhat fortunate in that I went to an international school and got my engineering degree in a fairly exclusive white university.
Black students must rise to the challenge of doing as well as their white counterparts.
In fact, some of the most brilliant pupils (in high school) were black.
Being black is not an excuse.
But I'd obviously be glad to hire brilliant black engineers because that would help dispel some unpleasant perceptions about blacks in general.
However, one needs to consider that most black kids do not have access to the educational facilities that white kids do (i.e. the best schools, access to computers, private tutors, etc), so obviously this counts against them.
This is an absurd for me that somebodys ethnic roots can be taken into account in case of admitting new students to universities.
The only significant factors should be a candidate's knowledge and qualifications.
The idea of affirmative actions is just an inverted discrimination.
Although it is true that affirmative action as a system is flawed, I challenge opponents to find a better solution - we would all love to hear it.
Until we have a government that is capable of and willing to address problems (racism, poverty, etc.) at their roots, affirmative action is necessary...even if it is a necessary evil.
As a Hispanic-American, I have been the beneficiary of affirmative action programs in my undergraduate and post-graduate education.
While many critics (for the most part white), argue that university admissions and financial assistance should be colour-blind, the unfortunate reality is that American society is not.
Applicants to top universities are regularly granted special status because of alumni preferment.
Other schools privilege athletes that bring little to the classroom (and in many sports, little economic gain to the university).
Some critics contend that socio-economic status should be employed instead of race or ethnic status for preferment, saying that affirmative action as it stands is racist and divisive.
Would preferment based on socio-economic terms not be classist and divisive pitting the rich against the poor?
The fact remains that admission to any university be it undergraduate or post-graduate is a fraught and arbitrary process in the US.
There will always be some winners and some losers.
In this case, affirmative action gives minorities a boost in the admissions process in the interest of creating a larger black and Hispanic middle class.
If some white middle and upper class candidates do not gain admission to their preferred school as a result, they will easily find placement at another institution.
Getting into university has always been based on irrelevant information.
If one wants to argue that race is not a valid point to let a person into school, then it must also be argued that the financial standing or ancestry of an individual is also irrelevant.
Therefore the only fair way to remove affirmative action is also to remove finances and alumni relations from any application or interview.
As long as financial, alumni, and ancestral criteria remain legitimate, than so will affirmative action.
It's only fair that Universities be allowed to use affirmative action.
Minorities have been discriminated against in the US for 100's of years.
Affirmative Action is not a handout, it's only a small compensation for years of abuse by the US government.
Minorities, who on average come from poorer backgrounds, have to prove they are above, at, or near the same level as white students.
The Supreme Court knows the playing field is not level, meaning if left unchecked, whites will dominate the universities.
Like most entitlement programs, Affirmative Action has existed long after it should have served its purpose.
Giving the underprivileged a leg up is a worthy endeavour, but extending it to the point where it becomes demanded and expected is a serious disservice to the people it was designed to help.
It is the equivalent of social institutionalization and should have weaned away gradually over the years.
Affirmative action has no place in the US or any other country.
At best it promotes those who are less qualified.
At worst it advances the incompetent and unmotivated.
The net result of affirmative action is that whenever a minority advances, whether it is a university admission or job promotion, their qualifications are questioned.
I am a 1999 graduate of the University of Michigan, and I think their "points-based" admissions policy is horribly wrong.
When U of M is considering a student, they place as much value in points on minority skin colour as they do on the admissions essay and high school percentile.
In other words, if you're an average student with limited writing skills who happens to be black, you stand as good a chance of acceptance as a white student in the top 10% with a perfect essay.
Fair?
No.
Racist?
Absolutely.
The Supreme Court's decision today is a huge victory for moderate liberals.
Although the SC has stated that affirmative action is OK in determining admissions to public universities, they have struck down the racial quota system that made affirmative action totally unfair.
However, the celebrations among supporters of affirmative action must be contained.
The Court's decision was based on a narrow alliance of swing voters and the few totally liberal justices on the Court.
If one of these justices retires, as is expected sometime soon, and the case comes up again, the outcome could be very different.
At last, a sign of common sense making its return.
Weighting a system in favour of one or other 'minority group' is discriminatory, and in the case of skin colour or ethnic origin it is clearly racism by any other name.
We have become so hypnotised by 'black rights' etc, that we now routinely give the white middle classes an unnaturally raw deal.
Education, jobs and everything else should be on the basis of ability, and quotas should be consigned to the dustbin along with racism.
Affirmative action, I believe was intended to be a limited duration project to integrate blacks and other minorities into a society that otherwise might have chosen to exclude them.
Unfortunately, continued economic disadvantage among blacks, when coupled with a continuing pattern of segregation and self-segregation, and the model of local education control means that affirmative action has not succeeded in "levelling the playing field".
I would agree that the best solution is to end the practice of locally organized schools funded by county or town property taxes.
Schools should be controlled at the state of federal level, with funding proportional to the schools needs, not surrounding property values.
Discrimination literally means to make a distinction.
Any laws that make racial distinctions, whether the Jim Crow laws or Affirmative Action, are clearly discriminatory.
Discriminatory laws should be removed from the American legal system, regardless of which race they seemingly benefit.
As a South African residing in the US, I have found myself drawing comparisons between affirmative action and Apartheid-era South Africa, when people were categorized into different racial groups and rewarded/oppressed accordingly.
It's common knowledge that most minorities in the US do not fare as well as their white counterparts in schools and colleges.
And no one can question that this is a very disturbing trend.
But a young person's chances of getting into college have more to do with that person's economic background than their race or ethnicity.
So, instead of using race as a criterion for entry into college, how about simply using socio-economic background?
Affirmative action is just a cover up for the real problems.
Nobody believes that Black or Hispanic people are any different from Chinese or white.
If there really is a problem of those people not getting enough chances it is not going to be solved through racism.
Problems should be handled at the root, although it is easier said than done.
And as for the universities I suggest they take an example at the Belgian universities, where a high school diploma and a maximum inscription fee are the only hurdles for an inscription.
That is an equal opportunities policy.
Somewhere I remember something about "All men are created equal" in the US Constitution.
Address the problem not create a solution.
So giving a white person a place at the expense of a better-qualified black person is racism, but giving a black person a place at the expense of a better-qualified white person is affirmative action?
Disgusting.
Equality means everyone is treated the same, regardless of skin colour.
The US Supreme Court's decision to allow admissions boards to consider race in the selection process, while stopping short of condoning quotas, is a good one.
Who could argue that diversity is not a good thing?
Exposure to all walks of life and all cultures can only enrich a student's learning experience, but the fact that the Court has to safeguard the use of race in admissions decisions is a tacit acknowledgement that minority students cannot effectively compete with their white counterparts.
Any fair-minded person knows this is not a matter of intellect but of opportunity, so society must work to provide all children, including minorities, with the educational tools they need, and this means starting at the very earliest levels of education.
It is not enough to reach down and help minorities up the ladder - we must boost them up from day one, just as we boost white children, using all the advantages parents' money can buy.
The assumption that racial diversity brings cultural diversity is extremely flawed and racist.
I am white.
I have friends of different races who I would consider very similar to me culturally because we grew up in the same area under the same economic circumstances.
I have also met people who look very much like me but who are very different culturally.
It is racist to look at someone's skin colour and to expect them to act a certain way based on it.
But that is what we do when we say that racial diversity is the same as cultural diversity.
The poor in the US do need help when it comes to educational opportunities.
Universities should set aside a certain number of spots based on economic circumstances or even regional background.
Admissions based on race are by definition racist and therefore unfair.
In the UK we are not generally familiar with the term 'affirmative action' and have fortunately managed to avoid what it seems to imply.
I fear that notions of 'positive discrimination' only serve to cause divisions rather than bridge them and that they inevitably lead to an unequal equality policy.
I hope that we manage to maintain our fairly good race relations without this sort of thing in future and that the US can eventually manage to overcome its more serious problems in a fair way - however long it takes.
Affirmative action has always been a joke, whether in academia or the workplace.
If two applicants are equally qualified, automatic preference is given to one on the basis of race or ethnic background.
This is so obviously racist that I cannot believe it has gone on for so long.
Let each applicant stand on his or her academic merits.
Why should anything else be considered for a university place anyway?
As a white American who could potentially lose out on graduate school admissions based on affirmative action, I must say I am still in favour of it.
Certainly my undergraduate education would have been incomplete if I had not been allowed to address and confront my racist upbringing in an African-American studies class.
I will gladly give up my seat at a top law school in exchange for a broader understanding of humanity.
Affirmative Action has served as a means of avoiding addressing the problems in inner-city and poorer school districts.
If favouritism ensures that minority students, who do not otherwise meet the minimum standard for admittance to competitive colleges and universities, will likely be admitted regardless, why bother taking care of the problem at the elementary, middle and high school levels?
America needs to acknowledge that our school system is in poor shape, and fix the problem where it begins.
Only then will students from poorer school districts have a chance to flourish at the university level.
The ultimate solution to racial educational disparity in the USA would involve a national, standardized curriculum for all high school students regardless of school district, racial or economic background.
As long as conservative forces in the US govt prevent this from being achieved, affirmative action must stay as an unpleasant, unpalatable and indirect means to an essential end.

BBC NEWS   World   Americas   Mixed ruling on US affirmative action
The US Supreme Court has upheld the right of a university law school to take race into account when deciding whether or not to allocate a student place.
The court backed by five votes to four the University of Michigan graduate law school's policy of affirmative action which favours ethnic minority candidates.
However, by a majority of six to three, the judges also ruled that the university's policy of awarding applicants from ethnic minorities extra points when deciding undergraduate places was unconstitutional.
The BBC's Steve Schifferes says the court's decision has been hailed as an important victory by civil rights groups.
The rulings centred on a case brought by three white students whose applications for places at the university - one of them in the graduate law school - were turned down.
The students - who were backed by US President George W Bush - said the decisions to reject them amounted to illegal discrimination, and that if they had been members of a minority group they would have been accepted.
In the first case, Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor sided with the court's more liberal justices to decide in favour of the graduate law school's version of affirmative action.
She said the US constitution "does not prohibit the law school's narrowly tailored use of race in admissions decisions to further a compelling interest in obtaining the educational benefits that flow from a diverse student body".
In ruling against the university's points system for undergraduates, the judges decided that it was, in effect, a racial quota system under which a certain number of places were set aside by the university for minority candidates, and was therefore unconstitutional.
The US Government's chief law officer, Solicitor General Ted Olson, had appeared in court to support the students' case and condemn the Michigan admissions plan as unconstitutional.
President Bush has described affirmative action as resembling "quota systems that... exclude people from higher education... are divisive, unfair and impossible to square with the constitution".
Support for the university came from several civil liberties organisations and lawyers, including the American Bar Association.
The case was the most recent examination of US race relations since the court's decision in the Bakke versus Board of Regents case in 1978.
That case was brought by a white student, Allen Bakke, who argued that he had been passed over by the University of California at Davis medical school in favour of minority candidates.
In that instance, racial quotas were struck down, but universities were still permitted to consider race as a factor in admissions.

Joseph Lieberman Sen.
John Edwards WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A closely divided U.S.
Supreme Court ruled on Monday that racial preferences can be used in university admission decisions, its first ruling on the important civil rights issue in 25 years.
The nation's highest court upheld the University of Michigan's affirmative action policy that favors minorities who apply to its law school, but struck down the program for its undergraduate college because it went too far in providing an advantage to blacks, Hispanics and Native Americans.
In upholding the law school's policy, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor said for the majority in the 5-4 ruling that student body diversity is a compelling state interest that can justify use of race in admissions decisions.
The rulings set out standards to be used by public and private universities throughout the country in their programs that help minorities gain admission.
Mary Sue Coleman, the University of Michigan president, said, "What it means is that at its core, affirmative action may still be used, and the court's given us a road map to get there."
The high court reaffirmed the principles set out in its historic 1978 "Bakke v.
Board of Regents" ruling, which struck down racial quotas but allowed race to be considered as a factor in university admissions.
O'Connor, a key swing vote on the court divided between conservative and liberal factions, endorsed the opinion by Justice Lewis Powell in 1978 that race can be considered.
She said major American businesses have made clear that the skills needed in today's increasingly global marketplace can only be developed through exposure to widely diverse people, cultures, ideas and viewpoints.
O'Connor also said high-ranking retired officers and civilian military leaders have asserted that a highly qualified, racially diverse officer corps is essential to national security.
And because universities and law schools represent the training ground for a large number of the nation's leaders, the path to leadership must be open to talented and qualified individuals of every race and ethnic background, she said.
Still, O'Connor made clear the programs cannot continue indefinitely.
"We expect that 25 years from now, the use of racial preferences will no longer be necessary to further the interest approved today."
And she said all factors, including race, that may contribute to diversity, must be considered.
Supporters of affirmative action hailed the ruling.
Democratic presidential candidates such as Sen.
John Edwards of North Carolina, Rep.
Richard Gephardt of Missouri, a graduate of the University of Michigan law school, and Sen.
Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut applauded the decision.
"Regardless of where they start, every American citizen deserves an equal opportunity to make it into the middle class and beyond," Lieberman said.
Although President Bush supported three white applicants who challenged the law school and undergraduate policies, he also was encouraged by the ruling for "recognizing the value of diversity on our nation's campuses."
"Race is a reality in American life.
Yet like the court, I look forward to the day when America will truly be a color-blind society," Bush said in a statement.
Justice Antonin Scalia, one of the dissenters, said, "The Constitution proscribes government discrimination on the basis of race, and state-provided education is no exception."
Justice Clarence Thomas, a conservative and the court's only black, said, "Now we must wait another 25 years to see this principle of equality vindicated."
In the undergraduate case, Chief Justice William Rehnquist declared for the majority in the 6-3 ruling that the manner in which the university considered the race of applicants violated the constitutional equal protection provisions.
In the undergraduate case, black, Hispanic and Native American applicants get 20 extra points out of a possible 150 points under a selection index that considers academics, test scores and other factors, including race.
Rehnquist said the use of race was not "narrowly tailored" to achieve the university's asserted interest in diversity.
He specifically criticized the 20 points given to minority applications.
In the law school case, the admissions process does not involve a point system, but the university seeks the enrollment of a "critical mass" of minority students, which has ranged between 10 percent and 17 percent of each class.
Opponents of affirmative action had hoped the Supreme Court would use the Michigan cases to declare unconstitutional such programs as a form of "reverse discrimination."   2003 Reuters Limited.

1978 Bakke decision resurrected in ruling
ASHINGTON -- A conservative Supreme Court's deep skepticism about using race to decide who gets public benefits remained unchanged yesterday, but a majority gave college administrators a special dispensation, plus the benefit of the doubt.
Affirmative action -- that is, taking steps to ensure that minorities have access to government programs or funds -- survived one of its most severe challenges because, to the court's majority, education is a different kind of benefit.
Race-conscious admissions survived while other forms of what critics call preferences often have not.
Since 1986, affirmative action had steadily lost support within the court.
That trend swept away much of the authority of government to hire, fire, or lay off public employees based on race.
A key ruling in 1986, Wygant v.
Jackson Board of Education, set the tone.
Similarly, government policies awarding contracts based on race, designed to benefit minority-owned contractors, were severely narrowed, in rulings in 1989 (City of Richmond v.
Croson) and 1995 (Adarand Constructors v.
Pena).
New legislative districting plans, drawn on the basis of race to give minority voters a better chance to influence the outcome of elections, were frequently cast aside as a consequence of a foundation-laying ruling in 1995, Shaw v.
Reno.
All of those rulings were based on the majority's view of the Constitution's Equal Protection Clause.
During the lengthening string of rulings, the court had interpreted that clause to mean that "all racial classifications imposed by government must be analyzed by a reviewing court under strict scrutiny."
Another hallmark of those rulings was the court's unwillingness to accept affirmative action without hard proof that it was essential, to cure past discrimination or to stop ongoing discrimination.
Throughout that trend, however, supporters of affirmative action clung to an apparent exception: The court had said, in a strangely split, 4-1-4 ruling in 1978, that race sometimes could be used in the selection of entering students at colleges and universities.
That, at least, was what the justice casting that one vote in the middle -- Justice Lewis F.
Powell Jr. -- had said in the historic decision Regents of University of California v.
Bakke.
No one agreed with him, but since the other eight justices split in opposite directions, his view was taken as controlling.
The court, it seemed as time went on, might not take that view again -- in the post-1986 era -- if it had reexamined Bakke.
Howard Ball, a University of Vermont professor, in a book three years ago about the decision, wrote: "It is not hanging by a thread, but it has been battered by lower federal court judges and by political opponents of preferential affirmative action programs in American higher education."
Appeals came and went at the Supreme Court, and the justices chose to leave Bakke untouched -- and unreviewed.
In the lower courts, however, Bakke was losing favor as they began embracing the view that Powell's opinion had been overcome by the Supreme Court's widening rejection of race-conscious public policies.
In December, the Supreme Court stepped in to decide what the law is, now.
That resulted in two main opinions, resolving separate cases in which white applicants sued after being denied admission to the University of Michigan Law School and to its undergraduate schools.
The law school's use of race survived, the undergraduate policy did not.
Chief Justice William H.
Rehnquist recited the unchanging law on race as the majority in the undergraduate case sees it.
He quoted from Powell in the Bakke case: "Preferring members of any one group for no reason other than race or ethnic origin is discrimination for its own sake."
Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, in the law school case, did not quarrel in any way with that as the underlying constitutional principle.
She repeated the assertion that all racial classifications by government had to be strictly scrutinized.
But then she proceeded to rescue the Bakke decision and, with it, affirmative action at the college level, when the purpose is to achieve a "diverse student body," racially and culturally.
The court, she said, wanted to dispel the idea that "our affirmative action cases decided since Bakke" had ruled out the university's use of race.
"It is true," she wrote, "that some language in those opinions might be read to suggest that remedy past discrimination is the only permissible justification for race-based governmental action."
But, O'Connor went on, "We have never held that the only governmental use of race that can survive strict scrutiny is remedying past discrimination."
Besides, she added, the court had not addressed since Bakke whether race could be used "in the context of public higher education."
From there, her opinion moved into a lengthy analysis of why university officials should be taken at their word when they insist they are using race for a benign educational purpose -- diversity among the students.
"Our holding today," O'Connor wrote, "is in keeping with our tradition of giving a degree of deference to a university's academic decisions, within constitutionally prescribed limits."

Race in admissions upheld
ASHINGTON -- A majority of the Supreme Court agreed yesterday for the first time to allow colleges to consider race in admissions decisions to achieve a diverse student body, settling nearly a decade of legal uncertainty about affirmative action on campuses.
The 5-to-4 majority, saying that "universities occupy a special niche in our constitutional tradition," ruled that race can be used as long as it is not the sole or controlling factor in admissions decisions.
That conclusion endorsed the opinion of a single justice, Lewis F.
Powell Jr., in the famous Bakke case in 1978.
Upholding an affirmative action plan at the University of Michigan Law School, the court stressed that such plans must end at some point, and appeared to suggest that time could come in 25 years, if the policies are closely monitored.
The decision departed from a pattern the conservative court has established in recent years of condemning the use of race as a determining factor in government policy making.
The court declared, in this instance, that "not every decision influenced by race is equally objectionable."
In a separate case focusing on undergraduate admissions at the University of Michigan, the court nullified, 6 to 3, a policy that automatically awarded bonus points to minority applicants.
Two justices who had supported the law school plan -- Stephen G.
Breyer and Sandra Day O'Connor -- took a different view of the undergraduate policy.
They called it "a nonindividualized, mechanical one," but they also noted that the university in Ann Arbor, Mich., "remains free to modify" its undergraduate admissions policy to make it constitutional.
O'Connor authored the key opinion upholding the use of race as an admissions tool and the law school's policy of individual consideration of applicants, including their academic background, race, and other factors.
Chief Justice William H.
Rehnquist wrote the decision against the undergraduate policy.
Overall, the nine justices issued 14 opinions in the two cases.
The affirmative action decisions harkened back to the equality principle of the court's Brown v.
Board of Education decision in 1954 to desegregate schools in stressing the importance of access to education: "The diffusion of knowledge and opportunity through public institutions of higher education must be accessible to all students regardless of race or ethnicity."
The rulings do not require undergraduate colleges or professional schools to use race as a factor, but allow them to do so.
Affected are most educational institutions in the country that are selective in granting admission, if they are run by government or receive public aid, including private elementary and high schools.
For an admissions plan using race to be constitutional, the court majority said, it must be "truly individualized" and operate "in a flexible, non-mechanical way."
Universities, the majority added, must maintain "continuing oversight" to ensure that a race-conscious admissions policy "will work the least harm possible to other innocent persons competing" for admission.
Noting a splintered decision allowing the use of race in college admissions 25 years ago in the Bakke case, the court declared: "We expect that 25 years from now, the use of racial preferences will no longer be necessary to further the interest approved today."
O'Connor's opinion for the majority turned Powell's in the Bakke case into the law of the land, without a legal doubt.
Colleges and universities had interpreted the Powell opinion to support affirmative action in admissions, but conservative activists and two circuit courts of appeals had disputed that his views were the controlling opinion in Bakke.
The law school decision was a sharp defeat for the Bush administration.
It had urged the court not only to strike down both Michigan programs, but to go further and rule that race cannot be used in admissions choices if there is any alternative to achieve a mixed student body.
The Constitution, the court said, "does not require exhaustion of every conceivable race-neutral alternative," although the court did say such alternatives are to be considered.
The court specifically rejected the administration's suggestion that universities could switch to a plan, similar to ones in use in California, Florida, and Texas, that guarantees admission to major state universities to a percentage of top-ranked high school seniors.
Those would not allow the necessary "individualized assessments," the court said.
President Bush praised the court for "recognizing the value of diversity on our nation's campuses," but emphasized the part of the ruling that said colleges must consider "race-neutral alternatives" before they adopt affirmative action.
"There are innovative and proven ways for colleges and universities to reflect our diversity without using racial quotas," Bush said in a statement.
Marvin Krislov, the University of Michigan's general counsel, called the ruling "a huge win," giving universities an "unequivocal endorsement" of race as a valid factor in admissions.
It also gave education officials "a clear road map to follow" in fashioning new affirmative action programs or changing existing ones, he said.
Although the court invalidated Michigan's point system for selecting undergraduates, Krislov said "we think we can replicate the law school plan in the undergraduate program."
The Center for Individual Rights, a conservative legal advocacy group that had mounted a sustained campaign to end affirmative action programs in college admissions, saw the ruling as "an explicit blow to preferences."
Terence J.
Pell, the center's president, said his group had gone from lonely opposition to a day when "the justices struck down one form of admissions preference at a major university."
Pell said he doubted that undergraduate colleges would be able to imitate the law school program.
The court found that the law school admissions program passed the constitutional test because it was not a quota, was flexible, and would work to achieve the benefits of educating a diverse group of students.
Under the law school plan, admissions officials seek to achieve a "critical mass" of minority students.
But the court said that was not a fixed number or percentage and allowed for the consideration of all types of diversity, not just differences in the applicants' races.
O'Connor's majority opinion was supported in full by Justices Breyer, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, David H.
Souter, and John Paul Stevens.
Dissenting were Rehnquist and Justices Anthony M.
Kennedy, Antonin Scalia, and Clarence Thomas.
Rehnquist, in the main dissenting opinion, said the law school program, "stripped of its  critical mass' veil, is revealed as a naked effort to achieve racial balancing."
In the decision on the undergraduate admissions program, Rehnquist wrote that it was invalid because it was not tied to the review of individual applicants.
He condemned the racial factor in the point system for admission, which awards minority applicants an automatic 20 points out of the 150 needed to ensure admission.
Joining Rehnquist's opinion in full in the undergraduate case were Kennedy, O'Connor, Scalia, and Thomas.
Joining in part was Breyer.
Dissenting were Ginsburg, Souter, and Stevens.

Some colleges must adjust procedures
America, officials at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst worried whether they could legally continue to consider their applicants' race.
The court majority permitted affirmative action only under a "truly individualized" admissions plan in which all student applications are read carefully and race is treated as one of many factors.
But such a plan is an expensive and labor-intensive way to run a college admissions office.
For UMass-Amherst to comply with the ruling would require more staff members and new resources, officials said yesterday.
But UMass-Amherst enrollment services has lost 25 percent of its budget to state cutbacks since 2000 and may shoulder additional cuts this summer.
The department has no money to expand the staff of eight readers who sift through 21,000 applications a year.
(The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, by comparison, has 20 readers for 24,000 applications, and takes more time than UMass readers with each file.)
"We can still use affirmative action, but it's a question of the staffing, a question of the resources," said Terence P.
O'Malley, general counsel of the UMass system.
"Given our budgetary constraints, it'll be a real challenge to continue considering race in admissions.
But at least the court says we can."
More than 150 US universities practice some form of affirmative action in admissions, as do scores of law, medical, and business schools, and officials at most campuses have craved the legal clarity on race-based policies that the Supreme Court sought to provide yesterday.
Based on the rulings, several officials say they don't expect any appreciable change in the number of minority students admitted to selective universities or graduate schools.
Over the long term, however, the rulings obligate colleges to try to find a way to end affirmative action in the next 25 years, a goal set by Justice Sandra Day O'Connor in one of the majority opinions yesterday.
Yet the new climate created by the justices -- hostile to numerical formulas, friendly to individualized admissions attention -- could drive minority enrollments up or down as schools try to fine-tune policies over the next year.
University of Texas officials, for instance, say the school may consider reviving some affirmative action policies that had been eliminated at Texas public campuses in 1997 after a federal appeals court said they were illegal.
The Supreme Court yesterday essentially overrode that portion of the appellate court decision.
At UMass-Amherst, where minorities make up 18 percent of the student population, enrollment services dean Joe Marshall said that proportion may fall slightly if race is no longer considered whatsoever, but noted that minorities can still earn "diversity" points for other reasons -- overcoming some form of "significant adversity," for instance.
At Chapel Hill, meanwhile, admissions dean Jerry Lucido said he hoped to recruit more minorities by using race-based scholarships that may be allowable under the new rulings.
(The University of Michigan's general counsel said yesterday that the new rulings will allow some consideration of race in student scholarship awards.)
In recent years many universities have moved away from hard numerical targets, in response to affirmative action lawsuits during the 1990s against state flagship universities in Georgia, Maryland, Michigan, Texas, and Washington, most of which lost in court.
Most elite private campuses, from large universities like Harvard to small liberal arts colleges like Bowdoin, are wealthy enough to hire large admissions staffs who interview most applicants and pore over admissions files, eschewing the point formulas used by Michigan.
Officials at several private colleges said yesterday they would continue evaluating applicants primarily on academic merit.
"We want to know about all kinds of characteristics -- Do you play a sport?
Did your parent come to Bowdoin?
What race are you? -- and we know how to admit students without formulas because our admissions officers spend a lot of time with each student's file," said Barry Mills, president of Bowdoin College in Brunswick, Maine, where 10 staff members evaluate 5,000 applications a year.
Perhaps the greatest challenge for all universities, several educators said yesterday, is to work with schools to overcome educational inequities and other social problems so that college affirmative action is no longer needed by 2028, Justice O'Connor's soft deadline.

Court Affirms Affirmative Action   June 23, 2003 19:50:40
"Affirmative action benefits all students.
It is a good day for our university."
Spectators and television crews gathered outside the Supreme Court Monday as the justices announced their ruling.
(AP) Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, the only black member of the court and an opponent of affirmative action programs, disagreed with the court's decision to uphold a University of Michigan law school policy to boost minority enrollment.
He agreed with the court's finding that a similar undergraduate program is unconstitutional.
"Because I wish to see all students succeed whatever their color, I share, in some respect, the sympathies of those who sponsor the type of discrimination advanced by the University of Michigan Law School," Thomas said, dissenting, in part, from the 5-4 decision upholding the law school's program.
Thomas accused the law school of maintaining "an exclusionary admissions system that it knows produces racially disproportionate results."
"Racial discrimination is not a permissible solution to the self-inflicted wounds of this elitist admissions policy," he said.
Thomas agreed with the court's 6-3 conclusion that a similar undergraduate program at the University of Michigan is unconstitutional.
He said a state's use of racial discrimination in higher education admissions is categorically prohibited by the Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution.
The U.S.
Supreme Court issued a pair of affirmative action rulings Monday   the first major clarification of this controversial issue in a generation.
Taken together, the rulings uphold affirmative action in principle as a way to promote racial diversity at public universities, but limit its use in practice.
"In order to cultivate a set of leaders with legitimacy in the eyes of the citizenry, it is necessary that the path to leadership be visibly open to talented and qualified individuals of every race and ethnicity," Justice Sandra Day O'Connor wrote for the 5-4 majority.
The court's conservative wing dissented, with Justice Antonin Scalia calling the effort to boost minority enrollment "a sham to cover a scheme of racially proportionate admissions."
Michigan students hailed the ruling and the law school's diversity.
"Affirmative action benefits all students.
It is a good day for our university," said University of Michigan student body president Angela Galardi.
But in a companion case, the court restated its opposition to racial quotas, ruling Michigan went too far in its undergraduate admissions policy.
The court struck down a "point system" which automatically awarded 20 points to minorities   one-fifth of the total needed for admission and far more than the points awarded for SAT scores or writing skills.
By a 6-3 margin, the court ruled the point system was unfair and unconstitutional.
Chief Justice William Rehnquist wrote that the policy, "which automatically distributes 20 points solely because of race, is not narrowly tailored to achieve the interest in educational diversity."
The ruling was a win for Jennifer Gratz, who brought the suit after being denied admission despite a 3.8 grade point average.
"Their undergraduate policy is wrong and students deserve to be treated fairly.
To me that's a victory," said Gratz. says the two rulings, taken together, were "a defeat for opponents of affirmative action.
They were hoping that the court would come in and strike down the concept of affirmative action   the concept that you can use race as a factor in determining university admissions   and the court was unwilling to do that."
However, Cohen points out that as important as these rulings are in the context of higher education, they are not likely to have much of an impact on affirmative action cases outside the school context.
The court preserved the rules outlined 25 years ago in a landmark ruling that underpin the consideration of race at institutions or gatherings as diverse as military academies, corporate boardrooms and campus leadership retreats.
President Bush, who had opposed the Michigan law school admissions policy, said, "I applaud the Supreme Court for recognizing the value of diversity on our nation's campuses.
Today's decisions seek a careful balance between the goal of campus diversity and the fundamental principle of equal treatment under the law."
O'Connor said the value of diverse classrooms extends far beyond the campus.
Justices John Paul Stevens, David Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer joined her endorsement of a program in place at the University of Michigan's law school.
The law school uses an inexact admissions formula that gives extra consideration to blacks, Hispanics and to applicants from other groups the school says have historically suffered from discrimination.
The program has produced minority enrollment of between 12 percent and 20 percent over the past decade.
There is no fixed target, the school said.
"This court has long recognized that 'education is the very foundation of good citizenship,"' O'Connor wrote, quoting from another landmark ruling, the Brown v.
Board of Education decision that integrated public schools.
"For this reason, the diffusion of knowledge and opportunity through public institutions of higher education must be accessible to all individuals regardless of race or ethnicity," O'Connor wrote.
At the same time, the court struck down the more rigid, point-based admissions policy for University of Michigan undergraduates.
The difference was a matter of degree.
The Constitution permits schools to consider an applicant's race as one among many factors when weighing which students will win a place at a top-notch school, O'Connor wrote in the more significant law school ruling.
What a school cannot do, she and other justices said, is install inflexible or automatic racial preferences.
The law school and its backers argued that a "critical mass" of minority students is essential to break down racial stereotypes and benefits the entire student body.
Minorities must be present in more than token numbers to ensure all students can interact, the university has said.
But no student's transcript will note that he or she "Works and Plays Well With Others," Scalia retorted, in mocking reference to language more often associated with grade school report cards.
Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justices Anthony M.
Kennedy and Clarence Thomas also dissented in the law school case.
Thomas, the court's only black justice, accused the law school of maintaining "an exclusionary admissions system that it knows produces racially disproportionate results."
"Racial discrimination is not a permissible solution to the self-inflicted wounds of this elitist admissions policy," he wrote.
Michigan says it accepts only academically qualified students, no matter their race.
In the companion case, O'Connor joined Rehnquist, Scalia, Kennedy, Thomas and Stephen Breyer to strike down the undergraduate school's 150-point grading system.
The school automatically gave minorities a 20-point bonus, more than for some measures of academic excellence, writing ability or leadership skills.
Outstanding athletes also got 20 points, as did impoverished applicants.
Stevens, Souter and Ginsburg dissented.
The cases put the Bush administration in an awkward spot.
The White House had sided with white applicants rejected at the Michigan schools but had not called for an outright end to affirmative action.
In the end, the high court made only bare mention of the administration's argument that race-neutral alternatives to affirmative action are already working in Mr.
Bush's home state of Texas and elsewhere.
Affirmative action programs should not go on forever, O'Connor wrote.
"We expect that 25 years from now, the use of racial preferences will no longer be necessary."

'A diverse student body is at the heart of the Law School's proper . . . mission'
'A diverse student body is at the heart of the Law School's proper . . . mission' rutter v.
Bollinger was about the affirmative action admissions policies at the University of Michigan Law School.
U niversities occupy a special niche in our constitutional tradition. . . .
Our conclusion that the Law School has a compelling interest in a diverse student body is informed by our view that attaining a diverse student body is at the heart of the Law School's proper institutional mission. . . . . . .
These benefits are substantial.
As the District Court emphasized, the Law School's admissions policy promotes "cross-racial understanding," helps to break down racial stereotypes, and "enables  students  to better understand persons of different races." . . . . . .
In addition to the expert studies and reports entered into evidence at trial, numerous studies show that student body diversity promotes learning outcomes, and "better prepares students for an increasingly diverse workforce and society, and better prepares them as professionals." . . .
In order to cultivate a set of leaders with legitimacy in the eyes of the citizenry, it is necessary that the path to leadership be visibly open to talented and qualified individuals of every race and ethnicity.
Chief Justice William H.
But this is precisely the type of racial balancing that the Court itself calls "patently unconstitutional." . . . . . .
Finally, I believe that the Law School's program fails strict scrutiny because it is devoid of any reasonably precise time limit on the Law School's use of race in admissions. . . .
Our previous cases have required some limit on the duration of programs such as this because discrimination on the basis of race is invidious. " I n regard to the colored people, there is always more that is benevolent, I perceive, than just, manifested towards us.
What I ask for the negro is not benevolence, not pity, not sympathy, but simply justice.
The American people have always been anxious to know what they shall do with us. . . .
I have had but one answer from the beginning.
Do nothing with us! . . .
Y our interference is doing him positive injury." . . .
Like Douglass, I believe blacks can achieve in every avenue of American life without the meddling of university administrators.
Because I wish to see all students succeed whatever their color, I share, in some respect, the sympathies of those who sponsor the type of discrimination advanced by the University of Michigan Law School.
The Constitution does not, however, tolerate institutional devotion to the status quo in admissions policies when such devotion ripens into racial discrimination.
The "educational benefit" that the University of Michigan seeks to achieve by racial discrimination consists, according to the Court, of "cross-racial understanding" . . . and "better prepar ation of  students for an increasingly diverse workforce and society.". . .
This is not, of course, an "educational benefit" on which students will be graded on their Law School transcript (Works and Plays Well with Others: B ) or tested by the bar examiners (Q: Describe in 500 words or less your cross-racial understanding).
Below are excerpts from the Supreme Court's decisions in Gratz v.
The admissions program Justice Powell described, however, did not contemplate that any single characteristic automatically ensured a specific and identifiable contribution to a university's diversity. . . . . . .
The current . . . policy does not provide such individualized consideration.
The . . . policy automatically distributes 20 points to every single applicant from an "underrepresented minority" group, as defined by the University. . . .
The automatic distribution of 20 points has the effect of making "the factor of race . . . decisive'  for virtually every minimally qualified underrepresented minority applicant.
In the wake "of a system of racial caste only recently ended" . . . large disparities endure.
Unemployment, poverty and access to health care vary disproportionately by race. . . .
Bias both conscious and unconscious, reflecting traditional and unexamined habits of thought, keeps up barriers that must come down if equal opportunity and nondiscrimination are ever genuinely to become this country's law and practice. . . .
The stain of generations of racial oppression is still visible in our society, and the determination to hasten its removal remains vital.
One can reasonably anticipate, therefore, that colleges and universities will seek to maintain their minority enrollment. . . .
Without recourse to such plans, institutions of higher education may resort to camouflage.
If honesty is the best policy, surely Michigan's accurately described, fully disclosed . . . program is preferable to achieving similar numbers through winks, nods, and disguises."
Justice David H.
Souter, in a separate dissent: The one qualification to this description of the admissions process is that membership in an underrepresented minority is given a weight of 20 points on the 150-point scale.
On the face of things, however, this assignment of specific points does not set race apart from all other weighted considerations.
Nonminority students may receive 20 points for athletic ability, socioeconomic disadvantage, attendance at a socioeconomically disadvantaged or predominantly minority high school, or at the Provost's discretion. . . .
The very nature of a college's permissible practice of awarding value to racial diversity means that race must be considered in a way that increases some applicants' chances for admission.
Since college admission is not left entirely to inarticulate intuition, it is hard to see what is inappropriate in assigning some stated value to a relevant characteristic, whether it be reasoning ability, writing style, running speed, or minority race.
Justice Powell's plus factors necessarily are assigned some values.
The college simply does by a numbered scale what the law school accomplishes in its  holistic review.'

supporters of affirmative action are pleasantly surprised
ASHINGTON -- Proaffirmative action groups, who had feared that the Supreme Court's conservative majority would outlaw the use of race in college admissions, greeted yesterday's rulings with a mix of surprise and praise.
"This is a momentous day in American civil-rights history," said Elaine R.
Jones, president and director-counsel of the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund, which filed briefs in support of the University of Michigan's affirmative action programs.
"It's a solid win.
It's a very good day."
But some opponents of the Michigan process also claimed victory, saying the court's dismissal of an undergraduate admissions program that gave minority applicants additional points was evidence that affirmative action's days are numbered.
"What we're seeing today is the beginning of the end of race preferences," said Terence J.
Pell, president of the Center for Individual Rights, the public interest law firm that represented the three applicants suing the university over its affirmative action programs.
"You can have diversity without the use of race preferences.
Overall, I think it's a big step forward."
Other conservatives, however, expressed strong disappointment.
"I'm very unhappy about the decisions," said Abigail Thernstrom, a member of the US Civil Rights Commission and a longtime opponent of affirmative action.
"I think it's not a victory at all.
All the court said was do it a little more subtly, don't be so in-your-face about it."
"I would have wanted to see the University of Michigan's policies knocked down," said Ruben Duran, a Hispanic senior at Michigan.
"I would have liked to have seen an end to the use of racial preferences in college admissions.
Period."
Instead, the court struck down Michigan's undergraduate admissions program because it was not tailored narrowly enough to meet the school's goal of diversity without violating the Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution.
However, the affirmative action policy at the university's law school -- less number-specific and geared toward reaching what school officials call "a critical mass" of underrepresented minority students -- was upheld.
Scores of businesses filed briefs in the Supreme Court supporting the principle of affirmative action.
Jay Waks, chairman of the labor and employment practice at Kaye Scholer, a large law firm in New York, said businesses embraced affirmative action long ago as the right thing to do and a practical way to boost the productivity and marketability of a company.
"These decisions will be very well received in the business community," Waks said.
"Many companies large and small have an interest in a diverse workforce."
Wade Henderson, executive director of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, said the rulings demonstrate that affirmative action programs are legal as long as they are tailored narrowly.
He also suggested that the court decision might prompt a change of heart at the Bush White House.
"I think the decisions now require the president to reevaluate his stance in opposition to affirmative action," Henderson said.
"I think this decision is a direct repudiation of the president's attempt to scapegoat both programs."
Affirmative action supporters, specifically Democrats who oppose President Bush on many fronts, struck a similar tone.
"All of us here know the vast importance of affirmative action and its essential role in achieving genuinely equal opportunity for all in our society," Senator Edward M.
Kennedy of Massachusetts told an audience yesterday in Boston as he received an award for his civil-rights work.
While Pell and others are hoping to make further inroads against affirmative action policies, Thernstrom said she fears the battle has been lost.
"Racial preferences will continue," she said.
"Nobody will stop them.
As far as I'm concerned, this is the end of that discussion."

Two Cheers For Affirmative Action   June 24, 2003 01:07:59
Affirmative action supporters, Candyce Phoenix, 18, left, and Aaron Nelson, 20, from Washington, D.C., rally in front the Supreme Court Monday, June 23, 2003.
(AP) "The Law School engages in a highly individualized, holistic review of each applicant's file, giving serious consideration to all the ways an applicant might contribute to a diverse educational experience."
Adam Dancy, an undergraduate student at the University of Michigan, protests in front of the Supreme Court after the ruling on affirmative action in college admissions Monday, June 23, 2003.
(AP) Sometimes the Supreme Court surprises us with its audaciousness.
The Justices' controversial Florida recount ruling in December 2000 is a good recent example of that.
And sometimes the Court surprises us with its restraint.
Monday's affirmative action rulings are vivid examples of that.
Instead of wiping out race from the admissions process at the University of Michigan and elsewhere, the Court's majority instead reaffirmed and clarified existing precedent.
And in many ways it strengthened the law's commitment to affirmative action in academia.
It was quite literally, and in an old-fashioned sense, a conservative ruling from this conservative court.
By a 5-4 vote, the Court upheld the admissions policy used by Michigan's law school, a policy that permits the school to consider race among other factors in determining which applicants are accepted and which are not in order to create a "critical mass" of diversity.
By a 6-3 vote, the Court struck down the University's undergraduate policy because it contained a "mechanical, predetermined diversity 'bonus'" for candidates of color.
But a majority of the Justices in both cases upheld the general concept of affirmative action.
In both cases they made it clear that schools like Michigan have a "compelling interest" in striving for and achieving racial diversity within their student populations.
Forget, then, all the talk you've heard about these cases representing a "split decision" by the Court.
Contrary to the White House spin Monday afternoon (read the government's briefs if you really want to know where the Bush Administration stands on affirmative action), if there was a split decision by the Court, it was a 75-25 split with affirmative action opponents achieving by far the smaller measure.
The Court's stated attitude toward affirmative action in higher education, and its approach to Michigan's stated reasons for its policies, are far more significant, legally and politically, than is the fact that Michigan's undergraduate policy has been sent back to the drawing board.
There is a problem, Justice O'Connor told the undergraduate school, but it is an easy problem to fix and here's how to do it.
But no such problem existed with the law school's admission policies, O'Connor and four of her colleagues found.
First, the Court solidly endorsed its own precedent created in 1978 in the landmark Bakke case.
In Bakke, the Court found that the University of California's quota system for student applicants was unconstitutional, but that Harvard University's more individualized admissions policy was permissible.
It was the Bakke case, which gave us the legal standard by which the admissions policies of all public universities have been judged for the past generation.
It was Bakke that gave us the gray area between illegal "quotas" and legal racial classifications.
Bakke, it turns out, still lives.
The Court agreed Monday "that student body diversity is a compelling state interest that can justify the use of race in university admissions."
This is no small thing.
Many legal experts predicted the Court would turn away completely from Bakke and declare at the outset that there was no such compelling interest that would warrant treating the races differently.
Such a ruling-- which wasn't even a part of the majority ruling that struck down Michigan's undergraduate scheme-- would have doomed the school's policies and perhaps affirmative action in academia in general.
Likewise, there were pre-decision questions about how far the Court would defer to Michigan's administrators when the latter claimed that diversity was essential to their educational mission.
Those questions were answered clearly by Justice O'Connor, who wrote that deference to a "university's academic decisions" has long been the law of the land.
There followed in the Justice's long majority opinion an extraordinarily poignant, forward-looking view of how racial diversity would help achieve some of the nation's other long-term goals.
"Access to legal education (and thus the legal profession)," Justice O'Connor wrote, "must be inclusive of talented individuals of every race and ethnicity, so that all members of our heterogeneous society may participate in the educational institutions that provide the training and education necessary to succeed in America."
The late Justices Thurgood Marshall or William Brennan, the old lions of the left on the Court, could not have said it better.
Having found Bakke good law, and having recognized Michigan's compelling interest, it wasn't a big leap for the Court's majority then to find that the law school's policies were "narrowly-tailored to achieve that end."
Justice O'Connor found that the law school evaluated the race of student candidates in a "flexible, non-mechanical way" so that the question of quotas was a non-starter.
"Here, the Law School engages in a highly individualized, holistic review of each applicant's file, giving serious consideration to all the ways an applicant might contribute to a diverse educational experience," she wrote.
That formula, apparently, was good enough for Justice O'Connor, good enough for the Court's majority, and good enough for all those public universities out there that may want to know how to use race as a factor in admissions without getting in legal trouble for it.
It was not, however, good enough for the dissenters in the law school case, the Court's far right wing, which predicted that a generation from now legal scholars still will be lamenting the chaos and unpredictability of the Michigan affirmative action cases.
Justice Clarence Thomas, conceding that he shares, "in some respect, the sympathies of those who sponsor the type of discrimination advanced by" the law school, nevertheless found the Court overly deferential to the school, and overly and irresponsibly responsive to a "faddish slogan of the cognoscenti."
Justice Thomas then challenged the very foundation of the argument made by Michigan, then accepted by his colleagues in the majority.
"There is no pressing public necessity in maintaining a public law school at all and, it follows, certainly not an elite law school.
Likewise, marginal improvements in legal education to not qualify as a compelling state interest."
Justice Antonin Scalia, meanwhile, in his typical salty way, wrote that the Court's two rulings seem "perversely designed to prolong the controversy and the litigation.
Justice Scalia ended his page-long parade of horribles with the line: "l do not look forward to any of these cases."
Neither do I.
But that's what he gets paid the big bucks for and Monday, regardless of which side you happen to be on in the fight over affirmative action, the Justices clearly earned their pay.

Grutter v.
Bollinger   U. of Michigan admissions case majority opinion: Gratz v.
Bollinger (Grutter v.
Bollinger) (Gratz v.
Bollinger) The Supreme Court struck down a point system used by the University of Michigan to give minorities preference in undergraduate admissions.
The court, however, approved a separate program used by the University of Michigan's law school that gives race less prominence in the admissions decision-making process.
The Supreme Court left room for the nation's public universities -- and by extension other public and private institutions -- to seek subtler ways to take race into account than through a point system.
Analysts say the rulings mean that race-conscious policies in place that do not use a point system or other narrow systemwill probably remain in place.
The Supreme Court ruled Monday that race can be a factor for universities shaping their admissions programs, saying a broad social value may be gained from diversity in the classroom.
But race cannot be an overriding factor for schools' admissions programs, the court ruled, saying that such plans can lead to unconstitutional policies.
In separate decisions the high court struck down a point system used by the University of Michigan's undergraduate programs but approved a separate policy used by the University of Michigan law school that gives race less prominence in the admissions decision-making process.
The law school program was upheld by a vote of 5-4, with Justice Sandra Day O'Connor providing the swing vote by siding with more liberal jurists.
The undergraduate program was overturned 6-3.
The two Michigan cases directly address only admissions at public, tax-supported institutions.
But the court decision likely will have an impact on private colleges and universities, other government decision-making and the business world, all trying to boost minority enrollment without violating the Constitution's guarantee against discrimination.
"This is a wonderful, wonderful day -- a victory for all of higher education, because what it means at its core is that affirmative action may still be used and the court's given us a road map to get there," said University of Michigan President Mary Sue Coleman.
"I think today's opinions, taken together, constitute a strong endorsement of the constitutionality of affirmative action with the proviso that institutions have to make sure that they structure these programs the right way," added Ted Shaw, NAACP associate counsel.
The University of Michigan cases were the most significant test of affirmative action to reach the court in a generation.
At issue was whether racial preference programs unconstitutionally discriminate against white students.
The law school ruling followed the path the Supreme Court set a generation ago, when it outlawed quotas but still left room for schools to improve the odds for minority applicants.
Analysts said the rulings' combined impact would force universities and schools to abandon rigid systems as they sort through applications they annually receive from prospective students.
"The colleges can still look for diversity in their entering classes, but the question is how do they look to that?" said Lawrence Lorber, a former affirmative action official during the Ford administration and currently a partner for Proskauer Rose LLP.
"Because you can't establish point policies for minorities, you have to effectively be more creative and less definitive."
Two white women were at the center of the University of Michigan cases.
Jennifer Gratz was a top high school student in suburban Detroit in 1995, when Michigan rejected her application.
Barbara Grutter, a 49-year-old mother of two, ran her own consulting business.
Michigan's prestigious law school rejected her application in 1997.
The university acknowledges it has used race as a factor in admissions, relying on a complicated point scale to rate applicants.
Grades and academics are most important, but members of "under-represented" racial and ethic minority groups have received extra points, as do children of alumni, athletes and men enrolling in nursing programs.
Gratz's lawyers called the points granted for race a "super bonus," equivalent to a full grade point on a student's GPA.
The school's undergraduate program receives 25,000 applications each year and accepts 5,000.
African-Americans comprise about 9 percent of this year's freshman class, Latinos 6 percent and Native Americans about 2 percent.
The University of Michigan admission policy has been in place more than a decade.
Adam Dancy, an undergraduate student at the University of Michigan, protests in front of the Supreme Court Monday after the ruling on the use of affirmative action in college .
The court ruled that the law school's affirmative action policy, which considers race as a factor in admissions but does not assign specific weight to it, does not violate the equal protections clause of the 14th Amendment, while the undergraduate policy does.
Justices Stephen Breyer, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, John Paul Stevens, David Souter, and O'Connor voted to uphold the law school's affirmative action policy, while Justices Anthony Kennedy, William Rehnquist, Antonin Scalia, and Clarence Thomas dissented.
O'Connor, writing the majority opinion, said the Constitution "does not prohibit the law school's narrowly tailored use of race in admissions decisions to further a compelling interest in obtaining the educational benefits that flow from a diverse student body."
The court agreed with the university's arguments that the law school policy "promotes 'cross-racial understanding,' helps to break down racial stereotypes, and 'enables  students  to better understand persons of different races,'" she wrote.
Thomas, in his dissenting opinion, said, "The law school, of its own choosing, and for its own purposes, maintains an exclusionary admissions system that it knows produces racially disproportionate results.
Racial discrimination is not a permissible solution to the self-inflicted wounds of this elitist admissions policy."
Justices Breyer, Kennedy, O'Connor, Rehnquist, Scalia, and Thomas voted to strike down the undergraduate program, with Justices Souter, Stevens, and Ginsburg voting to uphold it.
Rehnquist, writing for the court majority, said the program was unconstitutional "because the university's use of race in its current freshman admission policy is not narrowly tailored to achieve respondents' asserted compelling interest in diversity."
Souter wrote, "It is hard to see what is inappropriate in assigning some stated value to a relevant characteristic, whether it be reasoning ability, writing style, running speed, or minority race."

WASHINGTON   The U.S.
Supreme Court on Monday upheld a controversial  ) law school, but struck down a plan used by the undergraduate school that gave certain racial groups a head start in admissions.
The 5-4 law school decision validates the policy that allows those in admissions offices at the law school to not only take race into consideration, but to weigh it more than other factors, such as grade point average and test scores on standardized law school entrance examinations.
But the justices, voting 6-3, struck down the undergraduate school admissions policy that automatically gave blacks, Hispanics and Native-American applicants 20 points in a system in which 100 points were needed in order for a student to gain entry into the university.
Grutter v.
Bollinger Gratz v.
Bollinger Students that didn't fall into these racial categories argued that the policy put them at a disadvantage, since they had to earn all of the 100 points needed for entry based on merit, grades, test scores and other non-race-based criteria.
The school has also "flagged" minority applications, making it easier to keep an applicant in the pool even if he or she failed an initial review.
Both decisions, however, encouraged colleges and universities to explore more non-race-based admissions policies.
Critics of the system at the Ann Arbor campus said the process mirrored that of a quota system, while supporters say the process adds to a more diverse student body.
The policies even drew criticism from President Bush.
The White House weighed in on the legal process, filing legal briefs in opposition to the undergraduate school policy.
The administration argued that many more qualified students were passed over in the law school application process in favor of less-qualified minorities.
A Bush statement issued Monday afternoon said the decisions "seek a careful balance" between equal treatment and achieving campus diversity.
"There are innovative and proven ways for colleges and universities to reflect our diversity without using racial quotas," Bush said in the statement.
"The court has made clear that colleges and universities must engage in a serious, good faith consideration of workable race-neutral alternatives.
I agree that we must look first to these race-neutral approaches to make campuses more welcoming for all students."
University officials happily accepted the rulings.
"This is a great victory for all of higher education," University of Michigan President Mary Sue Coleman told Fox News.
"What it means at its core is that the use of affirmative action is upheld in all procedures for admissions."
With the court's decision, Coleman said, the campus also now has a "roadmap for bringing our undergraduate admissions in line."
Coleman would not directly say the school was out of line with its undergraduate program.
"We think that the diversity interest is important for all universities and all institutions," she said.
But critics say other schools shouldn't follow the University of Michigan's example. ), the organization that filed both lawsuits against the school.
"Any school that tries to use the law school system risks further litigation."
He criticized arguments made by supporters of the school's policies that the system simply tries to further diversity.
"This case isn't about diversity   8230; this case is about a segregated, two-track admissions system," Pell said, urging schools to follow the example of five states that have done away with race-based admissions altogether.
"That's the way to go," he said. ) -- who was widely viewed as a significant swing vote in the decision -- says that minorities' life experiences are of particular importance when universities weigh admissions applications.
The Constitution "does not prohibit the law school's narrowly tailored use of race in admissions decisions to further a compelling interest in obtaining the educational benefits that flow from a diverse student body," O'Connor wrote.

"Effective participation by members of all racial and ethnic groups in the civic life of our nation is essential if the dream of one nation, indivisible, is to be realized."
Rehnquist wrote the majority opinion in the undergraduate case.
He was joined by O'Connor, Scalia, Kennedy, Thomas and Breyer.
Stevens, Souter and Ginsburg dissented.
Government has a compelling interest in promoting racial diversity on campus, but the undergraduate school's admissions policy is not the way to get there, the court majority said.
"The university's policy, which automatically distributes 20 points, or one-fifth of the points needed to guarantee admission, to every single underrepresented minority applicant solely because of race, is not narrowly tailored to achieve the interest in educational diversity" that Michigan claimed justified the policy, Rehnquist wrote.
In the law school decision, the court upheld a 1978 ruling involving the University of California that said many factors contribute to a diverse and healthy student body -- including race, GPA, test scores and life experiences.
The court also said that in the Michigan case, the minority students who got in to the law school under the policy were very qualified and nothing overt was done, preferentially, to get those students into the school. ) system used in Texas and Florida.
Texas's practice was begun in 1997, when Bush was governor.
The system grants admission to state public colleges to all high school students who graduate in the top 10 percent of their classes.
The two Michigan cases directly address only admissions at public, tax-supported institutions.
But the court's rationale is expected to have a wide ripple through private colleges and universities, other government decision-making and the business world.
Opponents of affirmative action had hoped the Supreme Court would use this opportunity to ban most consideration of race in any government decisions.
The university has said that having what it calls a critical mass of minority students benefits the whole student body.
Minorities must be present in more than token numbers to ensure all students can interact, the university has said.
But Rehnquist dismissed that rationale in a dissenting opinion in the law school case.
"Stripped of its 'critical mass' veil, the law school's program is revealed as a naked effort to achieve racial balancing," Rehnquist wrote.
In 1997, the year that two white students sued, the school had 13,500 applicants and selected 3,958 of them as freshmen.
The white plaintiffs, Jennifer Gratz and Patrick Hamacher, were Michigan residents with good grades and other qualifications when they were rejected at the flagship Ann Arbor campus.
Both have since graduated from other colleges.

Split decision on racial preferences
The affirmative action decisions were the first major rulings on the issue in 25 years by the U.S.
Supreme Court.
June 23 -- A divided Supreme Court has upheld a University of Michigan law school admissions policy that gives minorities an edge.
NBC s Pete Williams reports.
The U.S.
Supreme Court on Monday upheld a University of Michigan law school policy that gives minority applicants an edge, but the justices overturned an undergraduate program that automatically awarded members of certain minorities 20 points toward the 100 needed for admission.
The court s decisions present Michigan and other schools with an administrative headache: The justices required all applicants to be given individualized consideration without using overt racial preferences.
THE COURT made it clear that the reason it upheld the law school admission policy while rejecting the undergraduate policy was that the law school gave what Justice Sandra Day O Connor called  meaningful individualized review  to each applicant.
The law school receives about 3,500 applicants each year, but the undergraduate school considers more than 25,000 applications annually.
Asked whether it would be possible to give  meaningful individualized review  to each of the 25,000 applicants, university President Mary Sue Coleman said,  I m absolutely confident that we will find a way.
But in its legal brief filed in the case, the University of Michigan had argued that the sheer number of applications received by the undergraduate school made it  impractical  for it to use the more personalized, case-by-case approach that the law school admissions process uses.
We will read the decisions very carefully and start working with our admissions people to make sure that our undergraduate  admissions  process will pass the court s muster,  Coleman told reporters who gathered on the steps of the Supreme Court building.
And the court has given us a road map.
They have basically said the law school s procedures are constitutional.    ... every school that wants to use race in their admissions and stay within the Constitution, as now interpreted by the Supreme Court, will mimic the process used by the University of Michigan ...
Temple Law Professor Mark Rahdert, who hailed the court s support of race-conscious admissions policies, also alluded to the burden the undergraduate school will now face.
My one concern is that an absolute bar on  bonus  point systems  for minority applicants  would be impractical for large colleges and universities that have to process tens of thousands of applications,  he said.
The law school gives race less prominence in the admissions decision-making process, while seeking to attain a  critical mass  of minority students.
The law school did not use an automatic bonus point system for minority applicants but did have a race-conscious policy of assessing applicant in order to see if they d contribute to student-body diversity.
There will be no need for covert use of race, because the Court has approved the use of race openly, so long as (it is) part of an individualized process.
The court upheld the law school program by a 5-4 vote, with O Connor siding with the court s more liberal justices to decide the case.
Writing for the majority in the law school case, O Connor emphasized that  race-conscious admissions policies must be limited in time.
She urged the school to use  sunset provisions  and  periodic reviews to determine whether racial preferences are still necessary to achieve student body diversity.
She also seemed to set a deadline for the school:  We take the law school at its word that it would  like nothing better than to find a race-neutral admissions formula  and will terminate its race-conscious admissions program as soon as practicable....
We expect that 25 years from now, the use of racial preferences will no longer be necessary....
June 23   NBC s Don Teague has reaction to the affirmative action decision by the U.S.
Supreme Court.
Yoo said,  The court has not mandated a 25-year sunset.
Nor has it really ordered periodic review.
But it will allow for litigation when people feel there is no longer any need for the programs, or when the mechanisms seem to be divergent from the goal of diversity.
The problem with the Court s opinion is that it does not really identify what racial diversity is, so it is difficult to know when it will have been achieved sufficiently to justify ending the use of race in admissions.
The court split 6-3 in finding the undergraduate program unconstitutional.
Chief Justice William H.
Rehnquist wrote the majority opinion in the undergraduate case, joined by O Connor and Justices Antonin Scalia, Anthony Kennedy, Clarence Thomas and Stephen Breyer.
Justices John Paul Stevens, David Souter and Ruth Bader Ginsburg dissented.
Applauding the decision in the law school case, Rahdert said,  The court allowed the law school to set the goal of achieving a  critical mass  of minority students and to monitor progress toward that goal without offending the Constitution.
Any other ruling on that issue would have rendered any kind of affirmative action practically impossible.
Rahdert also pointed to the fact that Rehnquist had assigned himself to write the majority decision in the undergraduate case, while assigning O Connor to write the decision in the law school case.
This suggests that the chief justice wanted to take what may well be his last opportunity to speak for the court on the issue of affirmative action,  Rahdert said.
It adds fuel to the speculation that the chief justice may be contemplating retiring at the end of this term.
The court s term is scheduled to end this Thursday.
The two Michigan cases were the most significant tests of racial preferences to reach the court since the 1978 Bakke decision, in which the court held that race could be used as one factor among many others in making college admission decisions.
At stake was the meaning of the 14th Amendment s equal protection clause, which says no state shall  deny to any person ... the equal protection of the laws.
The (Constitution s) Equal Protection Clause does not prohibit the law school s narrowly tailored use of race in admissions decisions to further a compelling interest in obtaining the educational benefits that flow from a diverse student body,  O Connor wrote.
In the case involving the university s undergraduate admissions, the high court said the bonus points that the school automatically awarded to all black, Latino and American Indian applicants was too rigid and heavy-handed a use of race.
Terry Pell, president of the Center for Individual Rights, the public interest law firm representing the white plaintiffs, said that many schools will likely abandon racial preferences rather than run the risk of legal challenges.
It s true that a school can avail itself of the law school rationale, but it is going to find itself in court pretty quickly, and that s expensive and risky,  he said.
I think most schools are going to do what hundreds of schools have done   achieve diversity without race preferences.
But Pell worried that at large state universities, when admissions officers are faced with huge numbers of applicants, it will be likely that they  will fall into the mechanical weighing of race in every single case.
Pell warned schools that  it will be difficult to persuade a judge that you have given individual consideration to every applicant  while not resorting to racial preferences.
He predicted additional litigation if schools fell into a habit of using covert racial preferences.
Commenting on the court s upholding race-conscious policies in the law school case, Democratic presidential contender Sen.
John Kerry of Massachusetts said in a statement,  The Supreme Court arrived at that conclusion by only the slimmest of margins.
It is frightening that it fell to a single justice to make the difference between protection of the most basic principles of affirmative action and the utter abandonment of 50 years of progress on civil rights in education.
Kerry also looked ahead to a potential Supreme Court vacancy.
