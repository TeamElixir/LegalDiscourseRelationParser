[6]   CAIRO, Egypt   -- The crash of a Gulf Air flight that killed 143 people in Bahrain is a disturbing deja vu for Egyptians: It is the second plane crash within a year to devastate this Arab country.

[13]  MANAMA, Bahrain, Aug. 24 -- Investigators have launched their effort to determine why a Gulf Air jet crash near Bahrain on Wednesday, after recovering the bodies of all 143 victims.
[14]  Bahraini authorities and U.S. Navy divers based in the Gulf recovered both "black boxes" containing data they hope will shed light on the disaster.
[15]   The U.S. search team is also scouring the scene of the crash for the confidential contents of a package that was being delivered by a U.S. State Department courier who was aboard.
[16]     But amid the wreckage, Bahraini U.S. searchers located the flight data and voice cockpit recorders -- near where the plane slammed into the shallow water off Bahrain's shore -- and they began the task of determining the cause of the crash.  
[17]  State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said Thursday that he did not know what Foti, one of 97 U.S. couriers, had with him aboard the airplane that crashed into the Persian Gulf on Wednesday night.

[23]  Investigators from around the world began gathering in Bahrain yesterday to ponder the odd final maneuvers of a Gulf Air Airbus A320 that crashed into the Persian Gulf Wednesday and killed all 143 people aboard.
[24]  Bahraini search teams, aided by U.S. Navy personnel and others, recovered the remains of the passengers and crew in shallow waters off the island nation hours after the aircraft plummeted into the gulf while trying to land at Manama, the Bahraini capital, after a flight from Cairo.
[25]   MINA SALMAN PORT, Bahrain (AP) -- A man's black shoe, a plastic sandal and bits of yellow foam padding bobbed Thursday in the waters off this tiny island nation, where families were burying loved ones a day after Gulf Air Flight 072 crashed, killing all 143 aboard. 
[26]  Bahraini authorities and U.S. Navy divers based in the Gulf recovered both ''black boxes'' - the flight data and voice cockpit recorders - near where the plane slammed into shallow water off Bahrain's shore.
[27]   Neither box appeared damaged, according to Bahrain civil defense chief James Windsor, who received the voice cockpit recorder Thursday from U.S. Navy divers who brought it to shore.
[28]  Ali Ahmedi, a spokesman and an acting vice president for Gulf Air, said it was too early to speculate on what caused the plane to crash as it circled the airport before coming in to land.
[29]  MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) _ Three bodies wrapped in cloth, one the size of a small child, were lain before the faithful in the Grand Mosque Friday during a special prayer for the dead in honor of the 143 victims of the Gulf Air crash.
[30]   Bahrain"s Prime Minister Sheik Khalifa bin Salman Al Khalifa and other top officials stood side-by-side with 2,000 Muslims reciting funeral prayers before the bodies, which were among the 107 adults and 36 children killed in Wednesday"s air disaster, said Information Ministry spokesman Syed el-Bably.
[31]  Twenty-six U.S. divers joined Bahraini experts scouring the sandy sea floor in search for more bits of wing and fuselage from Gulf Air flight 072. 
[32]  At dawn Friday, the divers began searching for "diplomatic cargo" being carried by a U.S. government courier, according to Cdr. Jeff Gradeck, spokesman for the U.S. Navy"s 5th Fleet, which is based in Bahrain. 
[33]  Flight 072 crashed in shallow water near shore and Ali Ahmedi, a spokesman and an acting vice president for Gulf Air, has said the pilot gave no indication to air traffic controllers that there were any problems in the plane. 
[34]  An archipelago made up of some 30 islands, Bahrain was once viewed by the ancient Sumerians as an island paradise to which the wise and the brave were taken to enjoy eternal life.
[35]  The probe into why Gulf Air Flight GF072 crashed into the sea off Bahrain Wednesday turned to possible pilot error Friday, despite the airline's insistence that the pilot was not at fault.
[36]  According to reports on CNN and local newspapers in Bahrain Friday, the control tower was concerned with the velocity and altitude of the plane and had discussed these concerns with the pilot as he circled the airport in his first approach to land.
