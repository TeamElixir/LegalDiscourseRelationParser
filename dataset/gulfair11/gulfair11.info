/clair6/corpora/CST03/families/manual/	gulfair11	63	2	08/23/00 08:30	MSNBC	MANAMA, Bahrain, Aug. 24 -- Investigators have launched their effort to determine why a Gulf Air jet crash near Bahrain on Wednesday, after recovering the bodies of all 143 victims.
/clair6/corpora/CST03/families/manual/	gulfair11	63	3	08/23/00 08:30	MSNBC	Bahraini authorities and U.S. Navy divers based in the Gulf recovered both "black boxes" containing data they hope will shed light on the disaster.

/clair6/corpora/CST03/families/manual/	gulfair11	63	6	08/23/00 08:30	MSNBC	   But amid the wreckage, Bahraini U.S. searchers located the flight data and voice cockpit recorders -- near where the plane slammed into the shallow water off Bahrain's shore -- and they began the task of determining the cause of the crash.  
/clair6/corpora/CST03/families/manual/	gulfair11	63	7	08/23/00 08:30	MSNBC	   Three U.S. military helicopters and 10 small ships are assisting in salvage efforts, which include attempts to recover the classified materials carried by a 31-year-old State Department courier, Seth J.

/clair6/corpora/CST03/families/manual/	gulfair11	63	13	08/23/00 08:30	MSNBC	 But he said there was no indication the pilot was anticipating an emergency landing.
/clair6/corpora/CST03/families/manual/	gulfair11	63	14	08/23/00 08:30	MSNBC	"The pilot did not make any kind of statements of problems in the plane," Ahmedi said.

/clair6/corpora/CST03/families/manual/	gulfair11	63	17	08/23/00 08:30	MSNBC	Airbus Industrie said in a statement on Wednesday night that the plane was powered by two CFM56-5 engines, which were built by a joint venture of General Electric and France's state-owned Snecma. 
/clair6/corpora/CST03/families/manual/	gulfair11	63	18	08/23/00 08:30	MSNBC	Airbus Industrie declined to speculate on what might have cause the crash.
/clair6/corpora/CST03/families/manual/	gulfair11	63	19	08/23/00 08:30	MSNBC	 The CFM56 is a popular engine, powering thousands of A320s, A340s and Boeing 737s.
/clair6/corpora/CST03/families/manual/	gulfair11	63	20	08/23/00 08:30	MSNBC	Experts say that modern turbofan engines rarely cause aircraft crashes.
/clair6/corpora/CST03/families/manual/	gulfair11	63	21	08/23/00 08:30	MSNBC	 They sometimes fail, but any twin-jet airliner can keep flying with its remaining engine, so an engine problem has to be fairly unusual to bring an aircraft down. 
/clair6/corpora/CST03/families/manual/	gulfair11	63	22	08/23/00 08:30	MSNBC	"The CFM56 has an excellent reputation for reliability, and it seems an unlikely contributor to a crash," said Gerard Frawley, an Australian aviation expert. 
/clair6/corpora/CST03/families/manual/	gulfair11	63	23	08/23/00 08:30	MSNBC	Under the best of circumstances, a water landing is risky, said Michael Barr, director of the aviation program at the University of Southern California.
/clair6/corpora/CST03/families/manual/	gulfair11	63	24	08/23/00 08:30	MSNBC	 Even a pilot coming in relatively slowly onto the water, hoping to skip across its surface like a stone, could clip a wing and lose control, he said.
/clair6/corpora/CST03/families/manual/	gulfair11	63	25	08/23/00 08:30	MSNBC	And the depth of the water would make little difference to the landing, experts said: A large airplane that crashes at high speed is going to be destroyed, whatever it hits. 
/clair6/corpora/CST03/families/manual/	gulfair11	63	26	08/23/00 08:30	MSNBC	Evidence of that destruction lay off Bahrain on Thursday.
/clair6/corpora/CST03/families/manual/	gulfair11	63	27	08/23/00 08:30	MSNBC	 In waters often less than 10 feet deep, shadowy bits of wing and fuselage, mostly in small pieces, were resting on the sandy sea floor.
/clair6/corpora/CST03/families/manual/	gulfair11	63	28	08/23/00 08:30	MSNBC	 A few recognizable pieces of the plane protruded from the water: a ripped tail wing with the airline's black, red and gold logo, skin of the fuselage with the letters 'LF AIR' above the surface.
/clair6/corpora/CST03/families/manual/	gulfair11	63	29	08/23/00 08:30	MSNBC	Most traces of the 143 victims were collected in the hours after the Cairo-to-Bahrain flight crashed Wednesday evening.
/clair6/corpora/CST03/families/manual/	gulfair11	63	30	08/23/00 08:30	MSNBC	Luggage and clothing that floated to the surface were removed so they wouldn't be swept away with the tides.
/clair6/corpora/CST03/families/manual/	gulfair11	63	31	08/23/00 08:30	MSNBC	Like the plane, many of the bodies were shattered, and relatives struggled to identify loved ones so they could claim their remains for burial.
/clair6/corpora/CST03/families/manual/	gulfair11	63	32	08/23/00 08:30	MSNBC	At a hotel in the capital, relatives sobbed as a Gulf Air official, his voice choking, read out the names of victims.

/clair6/corpora/CST03/families/manual/	gulfair11	63	38	08/23/00 08:30	MSNBC	 Mohammed Jassim, 45, an undertaker at the cemetery, washed disfigured faces and mutilated bodies with rose water before the remains -- still in body bags tagged at a makeshift morgue - were placed in freshly dug graves.
/clair6/corpora/CST03/families/manual/	gulfair11	63	39	08/23/00 08:30	MSNBC	"It's a painful sight," he said.
/clair6/corpora/CST03/families/manual/	gulfair11	63	40	08/23/00 08:30	MSNBC	 "I've handled dead bodies before, but none so dreadful to look at."
/clair6/corpora/CST03/families/manual/	gulfair11	63	41	08/23/00 08:30	MSNBC	   In 15-minute intervals, white Health Ministry vans pulled up at the cemetery to unload victims in tagged body bags.
/clair6/corpora/CST03/families/manual/	gulfair11	63	42	08/23/00 08:30	MSNBC	 Chants of "God is Great" and mournful wails wafted over the cemetery.
/clair6/corpora/CST03/families/manual/	gulfair11	63	43	08/23/00 08:30	MSNBC	 Relatives offered prayers for the dead, standing side by side, while others wept on each other's shoulders as clerics tried to comfort them.
/clair6/corpora/CST03/families/manual/	gulfair11	63	44	08/23/00 08:30	MSNBC	Thirty-six of the victims were children, officials said.
/clair6/corpora/CST03/families/manual/	gulfair11	63	45	08/23/00 08:30	MSNBC	 All appeared to have been traveling with their families.
/clair6/corpora/CST03/families/manual/	gulfair11	63	46	08/23/00 08:30	MSNBC	 Many families in the region are ending vacations at this time of year, which could account for the large number of children aboard.

/clair6/corpora/CST03/families/manual/	gulfair11	70	3	08/25/00 06:05	Washington Post	Grieving families, most of them Egyptian, also gathered to identify loved ones from pictures made after the crash and to take their bodies home. 
/clair6/corpora/CST03/families/manual/	gulfair11	70	4	08/25/00 06:05	Washington Post	Bahraini search teams, aided by U.S. Navy personnel and others, recovered the remains of the passengers and crew in shallow waters off the island nation hours after the aircraft plummeted into the gulf while trying to land at Manama, the Bahraini capital, after a flight from Cairo.
/clair6/corpora/CST03/families/manual/	gulfair11	70	5	08/25/00 06:05	Washington Post	Navy divers also located the plane's cockpit voice recorder and flight-data recorder.
/clair6/corpora/CST03/families/manual/	gulfair11	70	6	08/25/00 06:05	Washington Post	 If both contain usable data, particularly the voice recorder, the cause of the crash may become known quickly.
/clair6/corpora/CST03/families/manual/	gulfair11	70	7	08/25/00 06:05	Washington Post	 For the time being, however, investigators say they are puzzled about why the plane made two unsuccessful landing attempts at the airport, then suddenly fell as it began a third approach.
/clair6/corpora/CST03/families/manual/	gulfair11	70	8	08/25/00 06:05	Washington Post	Sources close to the investigation said weather in the area was good as the plane began descending toward Runway 12, a southwest-northeast strip equipped with radio navigation devices that would have allowed the crew to land on instruments even if the weather had been poor.
/clair6/corpora/CST03/families/manual/	gulfair11	70	9	08/25/00 06:05	Washington Post	 The A320 also has the latest navigation equipment, including an automatic landing system that presumably would have allowed the pilots to perform a hands-off touch down if they chose.
/clair6/corpora/CST03/families/manual/	gulfair11	70	10	08/25/00 06:05	Washington Post	The sources said that on its first approach to the airport the plane was too high to land, and that on its second approach it was too far off the runway centerline.
/clair6/corpora/CST03/families/manual/	gulfair11	70	11	08/25/00 06:05	Washington Post	 As the jetliner circled over the gulf to make a third attempt, it disappeared from radar at an altitude of 1,000 feet, the sources said.
/clair6/corpora/CST03/families/manual/	gulfair11	70	12	08/25/00 06:05	Washington Post	Ali Ahmedi, a spokesman for Gulf Air, said there was no indication the pilot was planning an emergency landing, according to the Associated Press.
/clair6/corpora/CST03/families/manual/	gulfair11	70	13	08/25/00 06:05	Washington Post	 "The pilot did not make any kind of statements of problems in the plane," he said.
/clair6/corpora/CST03/families/manual/	gulfair11	70	14	08/25/00 06:05	Washington Post	There was no official word, however, on what the pilots did say.
/clair6/corpora/CST03/families/manual/	gulfair11	70	15	08/25/00 06:05	Washington Post	 Normally, a pilot making a decision to "go around" would tell an air traffic controller of his intentions and the controller would clear him for another approach.
/clair6/corpora/CST03/families/manual/	gulfair11	70	16	08/25/00 06:05	Washington Post	The plane appeared to enter the water nose down, and the sources said it is significant that most of the bodies appeared to be relatively intact--perhaps indicating that the plane was moving relatively slowly when it crashed and broke up in 18 feet of water.
/clair6/corpora/CST03/families/manual/	gulfair11	70	17	08/25/00 06:05	Washington Post	 It is rare after an air crash to find a significant number of bodies that can be identified from facial features.
/clair6/corpora/CST03/families/manual/	gulfair11	70	18	08/25/00 06:05	Washington Post	Experts with Airbus Industrie, the European consortium that built the A320, are in Bahrain to help in the investigation, while investigators from France, Britain and the United States either had arrived or were on the way.
/clair6/corpora/CST03/families/manual/	gulfair11	70	19	08/25/00 06:05	Washington Post	The A320 was the first commercial "fly-by-wire" airplane, meaning that it is manipulated through electrical wiring rather than control cables.
/clair6/corpora/CST03/families/manual/	gulfair11	70	20	08/25/00 06:05	Washington Post	 Using a fighter plane-style sidestick rather than a control wheel, the pilot sends commands to computers that tell the plane how to do what he has commanded.
/clair6/corpora/CST03/families/manual/	gulfair11	70	21	08/25/00 06:05	Washington Post	Airbus also programmed "envelope" protection into the plane, meaning that the pilot cannot force it to make violent or stressful maneuvers.
/clair6/corpora/CST03/families/manual/	gulfair11	70	22	08/25/00 06:05	Washington Post	 For instance, even by pulling back hard on the control stick, a pilot cannot force the plane to climb so steeply that it would stall; the plane's computers take over and limit the angle of the climb no matter what the pilot does.
/clair6/corpora/CST03/families/manual/	gulfair11	70	23	08/25/00 06:05	Washington Post	 The computer will even note when the plane is slowing to a speed that could cause it to stall and will rev the engines to gain speed.
