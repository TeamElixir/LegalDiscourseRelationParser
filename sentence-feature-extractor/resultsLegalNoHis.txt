the Court emphasized that, in addition to showing a reasonable probability that the defendant`` would have accepted the earlier plea offer,'' the Court is also`` necessary'' to show a`` reasonable probability that the end result of the criminal process would have been more favorable by reason of a plea to a lesser charge or a sentence of less prison time.''

But there is no redundancy problem because the misdemeanor provisions have different mens rea requirements.
