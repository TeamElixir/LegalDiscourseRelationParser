During the plea process, Lee repeatedly asked his attorney whether Lee would face deportation; his attorney assured Lee that Lee would not be deported as a result of pleading guilty.

Lee had in fact pleaded guilty to an`` aggravated felony'' under the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8U.S.C.§ 1101-LRB- a-RRB--LRB- 43-RRB--LRB- B-RRB-, so Lee was, contrary to his attorney's advice, subject to mandatory deportation as a result of a plea.
Based on that assurance, Lee accepted a plea and was sentenced to a year and a day in prison.

When Lee learned of this consequence, Lee filed a motion to vacate his conviction and sentence, arguing that his attorney had provided constitutionally ineffective assistance.

Applying thetwo-part test for ineffective assistance claims from Stricklandv. Washington, 466U.S. 668, the Sixth Circuit concluded that, while the Government conceded that Lee's counsel had performed deficiently, Lee's could not show that Lee's was prejudiced by his attorney's erroneous advice.
The District Court, however, denied relief, and the Sixth Circuit affirmed.

Viewing its resolution of the issue as debatable among jurists of reason, the District Court granted a certificate of appealability.

To establish that Lee 's was prejudiced by that deficient performance, the Government explained, Lee 's was required to show`` a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's errors, Lee 's would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial.''
On appeal, the Government conceded that that deficient performance had been deficient.

Lee had`` no bona fide defense, not even a weak one,'' so Lee`` stood to gain nothing from going to trial but more prison time.''

To demonstrate that counsel was constitutionally ineffective, a defendant must show that counsel 's representation`` fell below an objective standard of reasonableness'' and that a defendant was prejudiced as a result.
The Sixth Amendment guarantees a defendant the effective assistance of counsel 's at`` critical stages of a criminal proceeding,'' including when a defendant enters a guilty plea.

A defendant raising such a claim can demonstrate prejudice by showing`` a reasonable probability that, but for counsel 's unprofessional errors, the result of a legal proceeding '' -- for example , that counsel failed to raise an objection at trial or to present an argument on appeal would have been different.''
A claim of ineffective assistance of counsel 's will often involve a claim of attorney error`` during the course of a legal proceeding '' -- for example , that counsel failed to raise an objection at trial or to present an argument on appeal.

As We held in Hillv.

And, more fundamentally, the Government overlooks that the inquiry we prescribed in Hillv. Lockhart focuses on a defendant's decisionmaking, which may not turn solely on the likelihood of conviction after trial.

And a defendant facing such long odds will rarely be able to show prejudice from accepting a guilty plea that offers him a better resolution than would be likely after trial.
A defendant without any viable defense will be highly likely to lose at trial.

But that is not because the prejudice inquiry in this context looks to the probability of a conviction for its own sake.

Where a defendant has no plausible chance of an acquittal at trial, it is highly likely that a defendant will accept a plea if the Government offers one.

The decision whether to plead guilty also involves assessing the respective consequences of a conviction after trial and by plea.
But common sense-LRB- not to mention our precedent-RRB- recognizes that there is more to consider than simply the likelihood of success at trial.

When the respective consequences of a conviction are, from the defendant's perspective, similarly dire, even the smallest chance of success at trial may look attractive.
The decision whether to plead guilty also involves assessing the respective consequences of a conviction after trial and by plea.

For example, a defendant with no realistic defense to a charge carrying a20-year sentence may nevertheless choose trial, if the prosecution's plea offer is 18 years.
When those consequences are, from the defendant's perspective, similarly dire, even the smallest chance of success at trial may look attractive.

Lee says Lee accordingly would have rejected any plea leading to deportation-- even if deportation after some time in prison shaved off prison time-- in favor of throwing a`` Hail Mary'' at trial.
Here Lee alleges that avoiding deportation was the determinative factor for Lee; deportation after some time in prison was not meaningfully different from deportation after somewhat less time.

The Government urges that, in such circumstances, the possibility of an acquittal after trial is`` irrelevant to the prejudice inquiry,'' pointing to our statement in Strickland that''-LSB- a-RSB- defendant has no entitlement to the luck of a lawless decisionmaker.''

As an initial matter, I remain of the view that the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution does not`` requir-LSB- e-RSB- counsel to provide accurate advice concerning the potential removal consequences of a guilty plea.''
Neither the Sixth Amendment nor this Court's precedents support that conclusion.

I would therefore affirm the Court of Appeals on the ground that the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution does not apply to the allegedly ineffective assistance in this case.

Because the Court today announces a novel standard for prejudice at the plea stage, I further dissent on the separate ground that its standard does not follow from our precedents.

The Court in Strickland v. Washington , 466 U. S. 668 -LRB- 1984 -RRB- held that a defendant may establish a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel by showing that his`` counsel's representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness'' and, as relevant here, that his `` counsel 's representation prejudiced a defendant by`` actually ha-LSB- ving-RSB- an adverse effect on this context.''
The Court and both of the parties agree that the prejudice inquiry in this context is governed by Strickland v. Washington , 466 U. S. 668 -LRB- 1984 -RRB-.

To establish prejudice under Strickland, a defendant must show a`` reasonable probability that, but for counsel 's unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.''
The Court in Strickland held that a defendant may establish a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel 's by showing that his`` counsel's representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness'' and, as relevant here, that his `` counsel 's representation prejudiced a defendant by`` actually ha-LSB- ving-RSB- an adverse effect on the defense.''

Strickland made clear that the `` result of the proceeding'' refers to the outcome of the defendant 's criminal prosecution as a whole.
To establish prejudice under Strickland, the defendant 's must show a`` reasonable probability that, but for counsel's unprofessional errors, the `` result of the proceeding would have been different.''

the defendant 's criminal prosecution defined`` reasonable probability'' as`` a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.''
Strickland made clear that the`` result of the proceeding'' refers to the outcome of the defendant 's criminal prosecution as a whole.

According to Strickland, the`` assessment of the likelihood of a result more favorable to the defendant must exclude the possibility of arbitrariness, whimsy, caprice,` nullification,' and the like.''
That conclusion also follows directly from According to Strickland.

the `` assessment of the likelihood of a result more favorable to the defendant does not depend on subjective factors such as`` the idiosyncrasies of the particular decisionmaker,'' including the particular decisionmaker`` unusual propensities toward harshness or leniency.''
According to Strickland, the `` assessment of the likelihood of a result more favorable to the defendant must exclude the possibility of arbitrariness, whimsy, caprice,` nullification,' and the like.''

It does not depend on subjective factors such as `` the idiosyncrasies of the particular decisionmaker , '' including the decisionmaker 's `` unusual propensities toward harshness or leniency.''

In other words,''-LSB- a-RSB- defendant has no entitlement to the luck of a lawless decisionmaker.''

But that requirement merely reflects the reality that the defendant 's can not show that the outcome of his case would have been different if the defendant 's would have accepted his current plea anyway.

The Hill Court went on to explain that Strickland'stwo-part test applies the same way in the plea context as in other contexts.
In other words, the defendant 's ability to show that the defendant 's would have gone to trial is necessary, but not sufficient, to establish prejudice.

In particular, the`` assessment'' will primarily turn on`` a prediction whether,'' in the absence of counsel's error,`` the evidence'' of Strickland 's innocence or guilt`` likely would have changed the outcome'' of the proceeding.

In particular, the`` assessment'' will primarily turn on`` a prediction whether,'' in the absence of counsel's error,`` the evidence'' of the defendant 's innocence or guilt`` likely would have changed the outcome'' of the proceeding.

In sum, the proper inquiry requires a defendant to show both that he would have rejected his plea and gone to trial and that he would likely have obtained a more favorable result in the end.

To the extent Hill was ambiguous about the standard, our precedents applying the standard confirm this interpretation.

In analyzing the prejudice issue, the Court did not focus solely on whether the suppression hearing would have turned out differently, or whether the defendant would have chosen to go to trial.
In that case, the defendant argued that his counsel was constitutionally ineffective because the defendant had failed to seek suppression of his confession before the defendant pleaded no contest.

the Court emphasized that, in addition to showing a reasonable probability that the defendant`` would have accepted the earlier plea offer,'' the Court is also`` necessary'' to show a`` reasonable probability that the end result of the criminal process would have been more favorable by reason of a plea to a lesser charge or a sentence of less prison time.''

the Court instead required the defendant to show that the ultimate outcome would have been different.
In short, the Court did not focus solely on whether the defendant would have accepted the plea.

In that case, the Court concluded that counsel may be constitutionally ineffective by causing a defendant to reject a plea deal he should have accepted.

In those circumstances, the Court has not held that the prejudice inquiry focuses on whether that stage of the proceeding would have ended differently.

It instead has made clear that the prejudice inquiry is the same as in Strickland, which requires a defendant to establish that he would have been better off in the end had his counsel not erred.

This point is key to the majority 's conclusion that petitioner would have chosen to gamble on a trial even though the defendant had no viable defense.

After explaining that a court should engage in a predictive inquiry about the likelihood of a defendant securing a better result at trial, the Court said:`` As the Court explained in Stricklandv.

In other words, Hill instructs that the prejudice inquiry must presume that the foregone trial would have been reliable.

Guilty pleas`` rarely'' give rise to the`` concern that unfair procedures may have resulted in the conviction of an innocent defendant.''
In any event, the Court in Hill recognized that guilty pleas are guilty pleas generally reliable.

Guilty pleas`` rarely'' give rise to the`` concern that unfair procedures may have resulted in the conviction of an innocent defendant.''

Guilty pleas, like completed trials, are therefore entitled to the protections against collateral attack that the Strickland prejudice standard affords.
That is because`` a counseled plea of guilty is an admission of factual guilt so reliable that, where voluntary and intelligent, a counseled plea of guilty quite validly removes the issue of factual guilt from the case.''

Hill, supra, at 57-LRB- emphasis added-RRB-; accord, Frye, 566,U.S., at 140-LRB-`` Hill established that claims of ineffective assistance of counsel in the plea bargain context are governed by thetwo-part test set forth in Strickland''-RRB-; Lafler, 566U.S., at162-163-LRB- applying Strickland-RRB-.

It instead concludes that one standard applies when a defendant goes to trial-LRB- Strickland-RRB-; another standard applies when a defendant accepts a plea-LRB- Hill-RRB-; and yet another standard applies when counsel does not apprise the defendant of an available plea or when a defendant rejects a plea-LRB- Frye and Lafler-RRB-.
The majority today abandons any pretense of applying Strickland to claims of ineffective assistance of counsel that arise at the plea stage.

That approach leaves little doubt that the Court has`` open-LSB- ed-RSB- a whole new field of constitutionalized criminal procedure''--``plea-bargaining law''-- despite its repeated assurances that the Court has been applying the same Strickland standard all along.
That approach instead concludes that the same Strickland standard applies when the defendant of an available plea goes to trial-LRB- Strickland-RRB-; another standard applies when the defendant of an available plea accepts a plea-LRB- Hill-RRB-; and yet another standard applies when counsel does not apprise the defendant of an available plea or when the defendant of an available plea rejects a plea-LRB- Frye and Lafler-RRB-.

In my view, we should take the Court 's precedents at their word and conclude that''-LSB- a -RSB- n error by counsel... does not warrant setting aside the judgment of a criminal proceeding if a -RSB- n error had no effect on the judgment of a criminal proceeding.''
That approach leaves little doubt that the Court 's has`` open-LSB- ed-RSB- a whole new field of constitutionalized criminal procedure''--``plea-bargaining law''-- despite its repeated assurances that the Court 's has been applying the same Strickland standard all along.

Applying the ordinary Strickland standard in a -RSB- n error, my do not think a defendant in petitioner 's circumstances could show a reasonable probability that the result of his criminal proceeding would have been different had a defendant in petitioner 's circumstances not pleaded guilty.

Petitioner does not dispute that a defendant in petitioner 's circumstances possessed large quantities of illegal drugs or that petitioner 's circumstances had secured a witness who had purchased illegal drugs directly from a defendant in petitioner 's circumstances.
Applying the ordinary Strickland standard in this case, I do not think a defendant in petitioner 's circumstances could show a reasonable probability that the result of his criminal proceeding would have been different had a defendant in petitioner 's circumstances not pleaded guilty.

In light of this`` overwhelming evidence of... guilt,'' 2014 WL 1260388,* 15-LRB- WDTenn.,Mar. 20, 2014-RRB-, the Court of Appeals concluded that Petitioner had`` no bona fide defense, not even a weak one,'' 825F. 3d 311, 316-LRB- CA6 2016-RRB-.
Petitioner does not dispute that Petitioner possessed large quantities of illegal drugs or that the Government had secured a witness who had purchased illegal drugs directly from Petitioner.

As His have explained, however, the Court in Strickland expressly foreclosed relying on the possibility of a`` Hail Mary'' to establish prejudice.
His only chance of succeeding would have been to`` thro-LSB- w-RSB- a` Hail Mary' at trial.''

Strickland made clear that the prejudice assessment should`` proceed on the assumption that the decisionmaker is reasonably, conscientiously, and impartially applying the standards that govern the decision.''
As I have explained, however, the Court in Strickland expressly foreclosed relying on the possibility of a`` Hail Mary'' to establish prejudice.

In the face of overwhelming evidence of guilt and in the absence of a bona fide defense, a reasonable court or jury applying the law to the facts of this case would find the defendant guilty.
Strickland made clear that the prejudice assessment should`` proceed on the assumption that the decisionmaker is reasonably, conscientiously, and impartially applying the standards that govern the decision.''

There is no reasonable probability of any other verdict.
In the face of overwhelming evidence of guilt and in the absence of a bona fide defense, a reasonable court or jury applying the law to the facts of this case would find the defendant guilty.

A defendant in petitioner 's shoes is thus plainly better off for having accepted his plea: had A defendant in petitioner 's shoes gone to trial, A defendant in petitioner 's shoes not only would have faced the same deportation consequences, A defendant in petitioner 's shoes also likely would have received a higher prison sentence.
A defendant in petitioner 's shoes, therefore, would have suffered the same deportation consequences regardless of whether A defendant in petitioner 's shoes accepted a plea or went to trial.

Finding that petitioner has established prejudice in these circumstances turns Strickland on its head.

For one thing, the Court's artificially cabined standard for prejudice in the plea context is likely to generate a high volume of challenges to existing and future plea agreements.
The Court today provides no assurance that plea deals negotiated in good faith with guilty defendants will remain final.

Under the Court 's artificially cabined standard for prejudice in the plea context, defendants bringing these challenges will bear a relatively low burden to show prejudice.
For one thing, the Court 's artificially cabined standard for prejudice in the plea context is likely to generate a high volume of these challenges to existing and future plea agreements.

Whereas a defendant asserting an ordinary claim of ineffective assistance of counsel must prove that the ultimate outcome of his case would have been different, the Court today holds that a defendant who pleaded guilty need show only that a defendant asserting an ordinary claim of ineffective assistance of counsel would have rejected his plea and gone to trial.
Under the majority's standard, defendants bringing these challenges will bear a relatively low burden to show prejudice.

This standard does not appear to be particularly demanding, as even a defendant who has only the`` smallest chance of success at trial''-- relying on nothing more than a''` Hail Mary'''-- may be able to satisfy an ordinary claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.

In addition to undermining finality, the Court 's rule will impose significant costs on courts and prosecutors.
Under its rule, so long as a defendant alleges that his counsel omitted or misadvised a defendant on a piece of information during the plea process that a defendant considered of`` paramount importance,'' ante, at 10, a defendant could allege a plausible claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.

Under the Court 's standard, a challenge to a guilty plea will be a highlyfact-intensive,defendant-specific undertaking.
In addition to undermining finality, the Court 's rule will impose significant costs on courts and prosecutors.

Petitioner suggests that each claim will`` at least'' require a`` hearing to get th-LSB- e-RSB- facts on the table.''
Under the Court's standard, a challenge to a guilty plea will be a highlyfact-intensive,defendant-specific undertaking.

Given that more than 90 percent of criminal convictions are the result of guilty pleas, Frye, 566U.S., at 143, the burden of holding evidentiary hearings on these claims could be significant.
Petitioner suggests that each claim will`` at least'' require a`` hearing to get th-LSB- e-RSB- facts on the table.''

For these costs, a defendant would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.
In circumstances where a defendant has admitted his guilt, the evidence against a defendant is overwhelming, and a defendant has no bona fide defense strategy, a defendant see no justification for imposing these costs.

The dissent also relies heavily on Missouriv. Frye, 566U.S. 134-LRB- 2012-RRB-, and Laflerv. Cooper, 566U.S. 156-LRB- 2012-RRB-.
For these reasons, I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.

Missouri v. Frye , 566 U. S. 134 -LRB- 2012 -RRB- , and Lafler v. Cooper , 566 U. S. 156 -LRB- 2012 -RRB- involved defendants who alleged that, but for their attorney's incompetence, Missouri v. Frye , 566 U. S. 134 -LRB- 2012 -RRB- , and Lafler v. Cooper , 566 U. S. 156 -LRB- 2012 -RRB- would have accepted a plea deal-- not, as here and as in Hill, that Missouri v. Frye , 566 U.

In both Frye , post and Lafler, the Court highlighted this difference: Immediately following the sentence that the dissent plucks from Frye , post, at 5-LRB- opinion of Thomas,J.-RRB-, the Court explained that its`` application of Strickland to the instances of an uncommunicated, lapsed plea does nothing to alter the standard laid out in Hill.''
Those cases involved defendants who alleged that, but for their attorney's incompetence, Those cases would have accepted a plea deal-- not, as here and as in Hill, that Those cases would have rejected a plea.

Contrary to the dissent's assertion, post, at8-9, Frye and Lafler do not depart from Strickland's requirement of prejudice.
Frye and Lafler articulated a different way to show prejudice, suited to the context of pleas not accepted, not an additional element to the Hill inquiry.

The issue is how the required prejudice may be shown.
Contrary to the dissent's assertion, post, at8-9, we do not depart from Strickland's requirement of the required prejudice.

Lee also argues that Lee can show the required prejudice because, had his attorney advised Lee that Lee would be deported if Lee accepted the Government's plea offer, Lee would have bargained for a plea deal that did not result in certain deportation.
The issue is how the required prejudice may be shown.

Given our conclusion that Lee can show prejudice based on the reasonable probability that Lee would have gone to trial, our need not reach this argument.

As we have explained, assessing the effect of some types of attorney errors on a defendant 's decisionmaking involves such predictions: Where an attorney error allegedly affects how a trial would have played out, we analyze that error's effects on a defendant 's decisionmaking by making a prediction of the likely trial outcome.

Such a prediction is neither necessary nor appropriate where, as here, the error is one that is not alleged to be pertinent to a trial outcome, but is instead alleged to have affected a defendant 's understanding of the consequences of his guilty plea.

The trial court sentenced Madison to death.
An Alabama jury found Madison guilty of capital murder.

In 2016, as Madison 's execution neared, Madison 's petitioned The trial court for a suspension of his death sentence.
The trial court sentenced Madison 's to death.

Madison 's argued that, due to several recent strokes, Madison 's has become incompetent to be executed.
In 2016, as Madison 's execution neared, Madison 's petitioned the trial court for a suspension of his death sentence.

The court held a hearing to receive testimony from two psychologists who had examined Madison and prepared reports concerning his competence.
Madison argued that, due to several recent strokes, Madison has become incompetent to be executed.

The court 's appointed psychologist,Dr. Karl Kirkland, reported that, although Madison may have`` suffered a significant declinepost-stroke,...-LSB- Madison-RSB- understands the exact posture of his case at this point,'' and appears to have a`` rational understanding of... the results or effects'' of his death sentence.
The court 's held a hearing to receive testimony from two psychologists who had examined Madison and prepared reports concerning his competence.

Dr. John Goff , a psychologist hired by Madison 's counsel, reported thatDr. John Goff , a psychologist hired by Madison 's counsel strokes have renderedDr. John Goff , a psychologist hired by Madison 's counsel unable to remember`` numerous events that have occurred over the past thirty years or more.''
Asked at the hearing whetherDr. John Goff , a psychologist hired by Madison 's counsel understands that Alabama is seeking retribution againstDr. John Goff , a psychologist hired by Madison 's counsel for his criminal act,Dr. Kirkland answered,`` Certainly.''

Nevertheless,Dr. Goff found thatDr. Goff`` is able to understand the nature of the pending proceeding andDr. Goff has an understanding of whatDr. Goff was tried for''; thatDr. Goff knowsDr. Goff is`` in prison... because of` murder'''; thatDr. Goff`` understands that...-LSB- Alabama is-RSB- seeking retribution'' for that crime; and thatDr. Goff`` understands the sentence, specifically the meaning of a death sentence.''

The trial court held that, under this Court's decisions in Fordv. Wainwright, 477U.S. 399-LRB- 1986-RRB-, and Panettiv. Quarterman, 551U.S. 930-LRB- 2007-RRB-, Madison 's was entitled to relief if Madison 's could show that Madison 's`` suffers from a mental illness which deprives-LSB- Madison 's-RSB- of the mental capacity to rationally understand that Madison 's is being executed as a punishment for a crime.''

Specifically, The court found that Madison understands`` that Madison is going to be executed because of the murder Madison committed-LSB-,-RSB-... that the State is seeking retribution-LSB-,-RSB- and that Madison will die when Madison is executed.''
The court concluded that Madison had failed to make that showing.

Madison then filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in Federal District Court.

As a state prisoner, Madison is entitled to federal habeas relief under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996-LRB- AEDPA-RRB- only if Federal District Court adjudication of his incompetence claim`` was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by'' this Court, or else was`` based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented'' in state court.
Madison then filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in Federal District Court.

A habeas petitioner meets this demanding standard only when A habeas petitioner shows that the state court 's decision was`` so lacking in justification that there was an error well understood and comprehended in existing law beyond any possibility for fairminded disagreement.''

The District Court denied Madison's petition after concluding that The District Court`` correctly applied Ford and Panetti'' and did not make an`` unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence.''

In The Eleventh Circuit view, given the undisputed fact that Madison`` has no memory of his capital offense,'' The Eleventh Circuit inescapably follows that Madison`` does not rationally understand the connection between his crime and his execution.''
The Eleventh Circuit granted a certificate of appealability and, on appeal, reversed over Judge Jordan's dissent.

On that basis, the Eleventh Circuit held that the trial court's conclusion that Madison is competent to be executed was`` plainly unreasonable'' and`` can not be reconciled with any reasonable application of Panetti.''
In the majority's view, given the undisputed fact that Madison`` has no memory of his capital offense,'' it inescapably follows that Madison`` does not rationally understand the connection between his crime and his execution.''

In Panetti, this Court addressed the question whether the Eighth Amendment forbids the execution of a prisoner who lacks`` the mental capacity to understand that-LSB- he-RSB- is being executed as a punishment for a crime.''
On that basis, the Eleventh Circuit held that this Court conclusion that Madison is competent to be executed was`` plainly unreasonable'' and`` can not be reconciled with any reasonable application of Panetti.''

We noted that the retributive purpose of capital punishment is not well served where`` a prisoner who lacks `` the mental capacity to understand that -LSB- he -RSB- is being executed as a punishment for a crime mental state is so distorted by a mental illness that his awareness of a crime and punishment has little or no relationship to the understanding of those concepts shared by the community as a whole.''
In Panetti, this Court addressed the question whether the Eighth Amendment forbids the execution of a prisoner who lacks `` the mental capacity to understand that -LSB- he -RSB- is being executed as a punishment for a crime.''

Similarly, in Ford, We questioned the`` retributive value of executing a person who has no comprehension of why the prisoner 's has been singled out.''
We noted that the retributive purpose of capital punishment is not well served where`` the prisoner 's mental state is so distorted by a mental illness that his awareness of the crime and punishment has little or no relationship to the understanding of those concepts shared by the community as a whole.''

Neither Panetti nor Ford`` clearly established'' that a prisoner is incompetent to be executed because of a failure to remember his commission of the crime, as distinct from a failure to rationally comprehend the concepts of crime and punishment as applied in his case.
Similarly, in Ford, we questioned the`` retributive value of executing a person who has no comprehension of why he has been singled out.''

The state court did not unreasonably apply Panetti and Ford when Ford determined that Madison is competent to be executed because-- notwithstanding his memory loss-- Madison recognizes that Madison will be put to death as punishment for the murder Madison was found to have committed.
Neither Panetti nor Ford`` clearly established'' that a prisoner is incompetent to be executed because of a failure to remember his commission of the crime, as distinct from a failure to rationally comprehend the concepts of crime and punishment as applied in his case.

Testimony from each of the psychologists who examined Madison supported the state court 's finding that Madison understands both that Madison was tried and imprisoned for murder and that Alabama will put Madison to death as punishment for the state court 's.
Nor was the state court 's decision founded on an unreasonable assessment of the evidence before the state court 's.

In short, the state court 's determinations of law and fact were not`` so lacking in justification'' as to give rise to error`` beyond any possibility for fairminded disagreement.''

Under that deferential standard, Madison's claim to federal habeas relief must fail.

After hearing the evidence, A jury needed less than two hours to return a unanimous sentence of death.
A jury convicted Tharpe of malice murder and two counts of aggravated kidnaping.

As aggravating factors, the jury found that Tharpe murdered Freeman while committing two other capital felonies-- the aggravated kidnapings of his wife and Freeman-- and that the murder was outrageously or wantonly vile, horrible, or inhuman.

The Government follows, The Government, from many of our cases emphasizing the`` jurisdictional significance'' of a notice of appeal.

Petitioner disputes this conclusion, arguing that his single notice of appeal sufficed under the Rules to appeal both the initial judgment and the amended judgment imposing restitution.
Accordingly,`` the court's duty to dismiss the appeal was mandatory.''

As we understand the Rules, his argument depends on two premises: First, in a deferred restitution case, there is only one`` judgment,'' as that term is used in Rules 4-LRB- b-RRB--LRB- 1-RRB- and-LRB- b-RRB--LRB- 2-RRB-; and second, so long as a notice of appeal is filed after both the initial judgment, it`` springs forward'' under Rule 4-LRB- b-RRB--LRB- 2-RRB- to appeal the amended judgment imposing restitution.

Although we did not decide`` whether or when a party can, or must, appeal''-- the question presented here-- we were not persuaded by the argument that`` a sentencing judgment is not` final' until a sentencing judgment contains a definitive determination of the amount of restitution.''
The petitioner in that case argued that the amended judgment imposing restitution is the only final, appealable judgment in a deferred restitution case.

To the contrary, we recognized`` strong arguments'' supporting the proposition that both the `` initial judgment-LSB- that-RSB- imposed a sentence of imprisonment and supervised release'' and the subsequent''` sentence that impose-LSB- d-RSB- an order of restitution''' were each immediately appealable final judgments.
Although we did not decide`` whether or when a party can, or must, appeal''-- the question presented here-- we were not persuaded by the argument that`` the `` initial judgment is not` final' until the `` initial judgment contains a definitive determination of the amount of restitution.''

the Rule to challenge a later-entered judgment in some circumstances provides that a`` notice of appeal filed after the court announces a decision, sentence, or order-- but before the entry of the judgment or order-- is treated as filed on the date of and after the entry.''

As this Court explained in construing Rule 4-LRB- a-RRB--LRB- 2-RRB-'s parallel provision for civil cases, the Rule to challenge a later-entered judgment in some circumstances`` was intended to protect the unskilled litigant who files a notice of appeal from a decision that the unskilled litigant who files a notice of appeal from a decision reasonably but mistakenly believes to be a final judgment, while failing to file a notice of appeal from the actual final judgment.''
A prematurely filed notice of appeal will become effective under the Rule to challenge a later-entered judgment in some circumstances.

By its own terms, however, Rule 4-LRB- b-RRB--LRB- 2-RRB- applies only to a notice of appeal filed after a sentence has been`` announce-LSB- d-RSB-'' and before the actual final judgment is entered on the docket.

Accordingly, the court does not apply where a district court enters an initial judgment deferring restitution and subsequently amends the judgment to include the sentence of restitution.
If the court has not yet decided the issue that the appellant seeks to appeal, then the Rule does not come into play.

By deferring restitution, a district court is declining to announce a sentence.
Accordingly, it does not apply where a district court enters an initial judgment deferring restitution and subsequently amends the judgment to include the sentence of restitution.

When petitioner filed his notice of appeal in this case, the District Court had observed only that restitution was`` mandatory.''
By deferring restitution, the District Court is declining to announce a sentence.

the District Court did not announce the restitution amount-LRB- or even hold a hearing on the issue-RRB- until months later.
When petitioner filed his notice of appeal in this case, the District Court had observed only that restitution was`` mandatory.''

Even if describing restitution as mandatory could qualify as a`` sentence'' that the District Court`` announced'' under Rule 4-LRB- b-RRB--LRB- 2-RRB-, petitioner has never disputed that restitution is mandatory for his offense.
the District Court did not announce the restitution amount-LRB- or even hold a hearing on the issue-RRB- until months later.

Rather, his argued on appeal that the amount of the restitution imposed-- an issue the District Court did not consider until months later-- is unlawful.
Even if describing the restitution imposed as mandatory could qualify as a`` sentence'' that the District Court`` announced'' under Rule 4-LRB- b-RRB--LRB- 2-RRB-, petitioner has never disputed that the restitution imposed is mandatory for his offense.

Because petitioner 's notice of appeal was filed well before the District Court announced the sentence imposing$4,500 in restitution, petitioner 's notice of appeal did not`` spring forward'' to become effective on the date the District Court entered its amended judgment imposing that sentence.
Rather, he argued on appeal that the amount of the restitution imposed-- an issue the District Court did not consider until months later-- is unlawful.

Finally, petitioner 's argues in the alternative that any defect in his notice of appeal should be overlooked as harmless error, citing Lemkev. United States, 346U.S. 325-LRB- 1953-RRB--LRB- per curiam-RRB-.

His notice of appeal was dismissed as premature under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 37-LRB- a-RRB--LRB- 2-RRB-, which then governed notices of appeal in criminal cases.
In that case, the petitioner filed a notice of appeal the day after his sentence was announced but three days before the judgment was entered.

This Court reversed on the ground that the premature filing was harmless error under Rule 52-LRB- a-RRB-.
His notice of appeal was dismissed as premature under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 37-LRB- a-RRB--LRB- 2-RRB-, which then governed notices of appeal in criminal cases.

Lemke has been superseded by the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure in two ways.

First, Lemke notice of appeal would now be timely under Rule 4-LRB- b-RRB--LRB- 2-RRB-.

The court of appeals may not overlook the failure to file a notice of appeal at all.
The court of appeals may, in its discretion, overlook defects in a notice of appeal other than the failure to timely file a notice.

The filing of a notice of appeal from an amended judgment imposing restitution is at least a mandatoryclaim-processing rule, PartII-A, supra, meaning that the requirement to file such a notice is unalterable, so long as the opposing party raises the issue.

The filing of a notice of appeal from an amended judgment imposing restitution is at least a mandatoryclaim-processing rule, PartII-A, supra, meaning that the requirement to file such a notice is unalterable, so long as the opposing party raises the issue.

Petitioner in this case did not file a defective notice of appeal from the amended judgment imposing restitution, but rather failed altogether to file a notice of appeal from the amended judgment imposing restitution.
By definition, mandatoryclaim-processing rules, although subject to forfeiture, are not subject toharmless-error analysis.

Because petitioner failed to do so, and the Government objected, the Court of Appeals properly declined to consider his challenge to the amount of restitution imposed.
We hold that a defendant who wishes to appeal an order imposing restitution in a deferred restitution case must file a notice of appeal from an order imposing restitution in a deferred restitution case.

The judgment of the Court of Appeals, accordingly, is affirmed.

That matter is settled, and the Court , today, leaves undisturbed prior opinions distinguishingclaim-processing rules from jurisdictional orders.
Time limits, such as those stated in Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure 3 and 4, and other limitations prescribed in a procedural rule, the Court , today has held, areclaim-processing rules, not jurisdictional requirements.

As I see That matter, a defendant wishing to appeal his sentence and conviction when a restitution determination has been deferred has two choices:-LRB- 1-RRB- a defendant wishing to appeal his sentence and conviction when a restitution determination has been deferred may immediately appeal his conviction and sentence of imprisonment, and later appeal the restitution order when made; or-LRB- 2-RRB- a defendant wishing to appeal his sentence and conviction when a restitution determination has been deferred may await the restitution order and then appeal, through a single notice, his conviction, sentence of imprisonment, and restitution order.
That matter is settled, and the Court, today, leaves undisturbed prior opinions distinguishingclaim-processing rules from jurisdictional orders.

But even assuming, arguendo , that separate appeal notices are ordinarily required, I would hold arguendo , that separate appeal notices are ordinarily required Manrique is not barred from appealing the restitution order in the circumstances of this case.

More than two years after his arrest, but less than two years after his criminal case was dismissed, Manuel filed a 42U.S.C.§ 1983 lawsuit against Joliet and several of its police officers-LRB- collectively, the City-RRB-, alleging that his arrest and detention violated the Fourth Amendment.
But Manuel remained in custody, spending a total of 48 days in pretrial detention.

on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the seventh circuit

Petitioner Elijah Manuel was held in jail for some seven weeks after a judge relied on allegedly fabricated evidence to find probable cause that Petitioner Elijah Manuel had committed a crime.
Justice Kagan delivered the opinion of the Court.

The primary question in some seven weeks is whether Petitioner Elijah Manuel may bring a claim based on the Fourth Amendment to contest the legality of his pretrial confinement.
Petitioner Elijah Manuel was held in jail for some seven weeks after a judge relied on allegedly fabricated evidence to find probable cause that Petitioner Elijah Manuel had committed a crime.

Accordingly, we hold today that Manuel may challenge his pretrial detention on the ground that his pretrial detention violated the Fourth Amendment-LRB- while we leave all other issues, including one about his pretrial detention timeliness, to the court below-RRB-.
And those constitutional protections apply even after the start of`` legal process'' in a criminal case-- here, that is, after the judge's determination of probable cause.

Shortly after midnight on March 18, 2011, Manuel was riding through Joliet, Illinois, in the passenger seat of a Dodge Charger, with his brother at the wheel.
Accordingly, we hold today that Manuel may challenge his pretrial detention on the ground that that claim 's timeliness violated the Fourth Amendment-LRB- while we leave all other issues, including one about that claim 's timeliness, to the court below-RRB-.

Shortly after midnight on March 18, 2011, Manuel was riding through Joliet, Illinois, in the passenger seat of a Dodge Charger, with his brother at the wheel.

According to the complaint in this case, one of Joliet police officers dragged Manuel from the car over when the driver failed to signal a turn, called Manuel a racial slur, and kicked and punched Manuel as Manuel lay on the ground.

Still, the officers arrested Manuel and took Manuel to the Joliet police station.

There, an evidence technician tested the pills once again, and got the same-LRB- negative-RRB- result.

But an evidence technician lied in his report, claiming that one of the pills was`` found to be... positive for the probable presence of ecstasy.''

Based on that determination, he sent Manuel to the county jail to await trial.
The judge relied exclusively on the criminal complaint-- which in turn relied exclusively on the police department's fabrications-- to support a finding of probable cause.

In the somewhat obscure legal lingo of this case, Manuel 's subsequent detention was thus pursuant to`` legal process''-- because Manuel 's subsequent detention followed from, and was authorized by, Manuel 'sprobable-cause determination.2
Based on that determination, he sent Manuel 's to the county jail to await trial.

While Manuel sat in jail, the Illinois police laboratory reexamined the seized pills, and on April 1, it issued a report concluding (just as the prior two tests had) that they contained no controlled substances.

On April 22, 2013, Manuel brought this lawsuit under 42U.S.C.§ 1983 against the City of Joliet and several of its police officers-LRB- collectively, the City-RRB-.
The County Court immediately granted the request, and Manuel was released the next day.

Section 1983 creates a`` species of tort liability,'' Imblerv. Pachtman, 424U.S. 409, 417-LRB- 1976-RRB-, for`` the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution,''§ 1983.
On April 22, 2013, Manuel brought this lawsuit under 42U.S.C.§ 1983 against the City of Joliet and several of its police officers-LRB- collectively, the City-RRB-.

Manuel 's complaint alleged that the City violated his Fourth Amendment rights in two ways-- first by arresting Manuel 's at the roadside without any reason, and next by`` detaining Manuel 's in police custody'' for almost seven weeks based entirely onmade-up evidence.

The District Court first held that the applicabletwo-year statute of limitations barred Manuel 's claim for unlawful arrest, because more than two years had elapsed between the date of his arrest-LRB- March 18, 2011-RRB- and the filing of his complaint-LRB- April 22, 2013-RRB-.
The District Court dismissed Manuel 's suit.

But The court relied on another basis in rejecting Manuel 's challenge to his subsequent detention-LRB- which stretched from March 18 to May 5, 2011-RRB-.

Binding Circuit precedent, the District Court explained, made clear that pretrial detention following the start of legal process could not give rise to a Fourth Amendment claim.
But the court relied on another basis in rejecting Manuel 's challenge to his subsequent detention-LRB- which stretched from March 18 to May 5, 2011-RRB-.

According to that line of decisions, a§ 1983 plaintiff challenging such detention must allege a breach of the Due Process Clause-- and must show, to recover on that theory, that state law fails to provide an adequate remedy.
Binding Circuit precedent, the District Court explained, made clear that pretrial detention following the start of legal process could not give rise to a Fourth Amendment claim.

Because Manuel 's complaint rested solely on the Fourth Amendment-- and because, in any event, Illinois's remedies were robust enough to preclude the due process avenue-- the District Court found that Manuel 's had no way to proceed.
According to that line of decisions, a§ 1983 plaintiff challenging such detention must allege a breach of the Due Process Clause-- and must show, to recover on that theory, that state law fails to provide an adequate remedy.

The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed the dismissal of Manuel 's claim for unlawful detention-LRB- the only part of the District Court 's decision Manuel 's appealed-RRB-.
Because Manuel 's complaint rested solely on the Fourth Amendment-- and because, in any event, Illinois's remedies were robust enough to preclude the due process avenue-- the District Court 's found that Manuel 's had no way to proceed.

Invoking its prior caselaw, The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit reiterated that such claims could not be brought under the Fourth Amendment.
The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed the dismissal of Manuel 's claim for unlawful detention-LRB- the only part of the District Court's decision Manuel 's appealed-RRB-.

Once a person is detained pursuant to legal process, the Court of Appeals stated,`` the Fourth Amendment falls out of the picture and the detainee 's claim that the detention is improper becomes-LSB- one of-RSB- due process.''
Invoking its prior caselaw, the Court of Appeals reiterated that such claims could not be brought under the Fourth Amendment.

And again:`` When, after the arrest-LSB-,-RSB- a person is not let go when a person should be, the Fourth Amendment gives way to the due process clause as a basis for challenging his detention.''
Once a person is detained pursuant to legal process, the court stated,`` the Fourth Amendment falls out of the picture and the detainee's claim that the detention is improper becomes-LSB- one of-RSB- due process.''

So the Seventh Circuit held that Manuel's complaint, in alleging only a Fourth Amendment violation, rested on the wrong part of the Constitution: A person detained following the onset of legal process could at most-LRB- although, the court agreed, not in Illinois-RRB- challenge his pretrial confinement via the Due Process Clause.
And again:`` When, after the arrest-LSB-,-RSB- a person is not let go when a person should be, the Fourth Amendment gives way to the due process clause as a basis for challenging his detention.''

the Seventh Circuit recognized that its position makes the Seventh Circuit an outlier among the Courts of Appeals, with ten others taking the opposite view.

The Seventh Circuit protects''-LSB- t-RSB- he right of the people to be secure in their persons... against unreasonable... seizures.''

This Court decided some four decades ago that a claim challenging pretrial detention fell within the scope of the Fourth Amendment.

The Court looked The Fourth Amendment to analyze-- and uphold-- their claim that such a pretrial restraint on liberty is unlawful unless a judge-LRB- or grand jury-RRB- first makes a reliable finding of probable cause.

In choosing that Amendment`` as the rationale for decision,'' the Court responded to a concurring Justice's view that the Due Process Clause offered the better framework: The Fourth Amendment, the majority countered, was`` tailored explicitly for the criminal justice system, and the criminal justice system-LSB--RSB- always has been thought to define'' the appropriate process`` for seizures of person-LSB- s-RSB-... in criminal cases, including the detention of suspects pending trial.''
The Fourth Amendment, we began, establishes the minimum constitutional`` standards and procedures'' not just for arrest but also for ensuing`` detention.''

The Fourth Amendment prohibits government officials from detaining a person in the absence of probable cause.
As reflected in Albright's tracking of Gerstein's analysis, pretrial detention can violate The Fourth Amendment not only when The Fourth Amendment precedes, but also when The Fourth Amendment follows, the start of legal process in a criminal case.

That can happen when the police hold someone without any reason before the formal onset of a criminal proceeding.
The Fourth Amendment prohibits government officials from detaining a person in the absence of probable cause.

But the formal onset of a criminal proceeding also can occur when legal process the formal onset of a criminal proceeding goes wrong-- when, for example, a judge'sprobable-cause determination is predicated solely on a police officer's false statements.
That can happen when the police hold someone without any reason before the formal onset of a criminal proceeding.

Then, too, a person is confined without constitutionally adequate justification.
But it also can occur when legal process it goes wrong-- when, for example, a judge'sprobable-cause determination is predicated solely on a police officer's false statements.

And for that reason, Legal process can not extinguish the detainee's Fourth Amendment claim-- or somehow, as the Seventh Circuit has held, convert that claim into one founded on the Due Process Clause.
Legal process has gone forward, but Legal process has done nothing to satisfy the Fourth Amendment'sprobable-cause requirement.

If the complaint is that a form of legal process resulted in pretrial detention unsupported by probable cause, then the right allegedly infringed lies in the Fourth Amendment.6
And for that reason, it can not extinguish the detainee's Fourth Amendment claim-- or somehow, as the Seventh Circuit has held, convert that claim into one founded on the Due Process Clause.

For that reason, and contrary to the Seventh Circuit's view, Manuel stated a Fourth Amendment claim when he sought relief not merely for his (pre-legal-process) arrest, but also for his (post-legal-process) pretrial detention.7 Consider again the facts alleged in this case.
If the complaint is that a form of legal process resulted in pretrial detention unsupported by probable cause, then the right allegedly infringed lies in the Fourth Amendment.6

Police officers initially arrested Manuel without probable cause, based solely on his possession of pills that had field tested negative for an illegal substance.

So-LRB- putting timeliness issues aside-RRB- Manuel could bring a claim for wrongful arrest under the Fourth Amendment.
Police officers initially arrested Manuel without probable cause, based solely on his possession of pills that had field tested negative for an illegal substance.

And the same is true-LRB- again, disregarding timeliness-RRB- as to a claim for wrongful detention-- because Manuel 's subsequent weeks in custody were also unsupported by probable cause, and so also constitutionally unreasonable.
So-LRB- putting timeliness issues aside-RRB- Manuel 's could bring a claim for wrongful arrest under the Fourth Amendment.

And that means Manuel 's ensuing pretrial detention, no less than his original arrest, violated his Fourth Amendment rights.

Our holding--that the Fourth Amendment governs a claim for unlawful pretrial detention even beyond the start of legal process--does not exhaust the disputed legal issues in this case.

With these precepts as backdrop, Manuel and the City offer competing views about what accrual rule should govern a § 1983 suit challengingpost-legal-process pretrial detention.

Relying on this Court's caselaw, Manuel analogizes his claim to thecommon-law tort of malicious prosecution.
According to Manuel, that Fourth Amendment claim accrues only upon the dismissal of criminal charges-- here, on May 4, 2011, less than two years before he brought his suit.

An element of that tort is the`` termination of the... proceeding in favor of the accused''; and accordingly, the statute of limitations does not start to run until that termination takes place.
Relying on this Court's caselaw, Manuel analogizes his claim to thecommon-law tort of malicious prosecution.

Man-uel argues that following the same rule in suits like his will avoid`` conflicting resolutions'' in§ 1983 litigation and criminal proceedings by`` preclud-LSB- ing-RSB- the possibility of the claimant succeeding in the tort action after having been convicted in the underlying criminal prosecution.''
An element of that tort is the`` termination of the... proceeding in favor of the accused''; and accordingly, the statute of limitations does not start to run until that termination takes place.

In support of Manuel 's position, all but two of the ten Courts of Appeals that have recognized a Fourth Amendment claim like his have incorporated a`` favorable termination'' element and so pegged the statute of limitations to the dismissal of the criminal case.

I join Justice Alito's opinion in full but write separately regarding the accrual date for a Fourth Amendment unreasonable-seizure claim.
on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the seventh circuit

Justice Alito 's suggests that a claim for unreasonable seizure based on a warrantless arrest might not accrue until the`` first appearance'' under Illinois law-LRB- or the`` initial appearance'' under federal law-RRB--- which ordinarily represents the first judicial determination of probable cause for that kind of arrest-- rather than at the time of a warrantless arrest.
I join Justice Alito 's opinion in full but write separately regarding the accrual date for a Fourth Amendmentunreasonable-seizure claim.

Which of those events is the correct one for purposes of accrual makes no difference in this case, because both the arrest and the `` first appearance '' under Illinois law -LRB- or the `` initial appearance '' under federal law -RRB- -- which ordinarily represents the first judicial determination of probable cause for that kind of arrest -- rather than at the time of the arrest occurred more than two years before petitioner filed suit.

Justice Alito agree with the Court's holding up to a point: The protection provided by the Fourth Amendment continues to apply after`` the start of legal process,'' ante, at 1, if legal process is understood to mean the issuance of an arrest warrant or what is called a`` first appearance'' under Illinois law and an`` initial appearance'' under federal law.
Justice Alito, with whom Justice Thomas joins, dissenting.

But if the Court 's means more-- specifically, that new Fourth Amendment claims continue to accrue as long as pretrial detention lasts-- the Court 's stretches the concept of a seizure much too far.

What is perhaps most remarkable about the Court 's approach is that the Court 's approach entirely ignores the question that we agreed to decide,i.e., whether a claim of malicious prosecution may be brought under the Fourth Amendment.

I would first consider what I take to be the core of the question presented-- whether a`` malicious prosecution claim may be brought under the Fourth Amendment.''

The statute of limitations for Manuel 's claim is Illinois's general statute of limitations forpersonal-injury torts, see Wallacev. Kato, 549U.S. 384, 387-LRB- 2007-RRB-, which requires suit to be brought within two years of the accrual of the claim, seeIll..
Manuel 's asked us to decide that question because the accrual of the claim may be critical to his ultimate success in this lawsuit.

Here is the chronology of relevant events in this case:

March 18, 2011: Manuel is arrested and brought before a county court judge, who makes the required probable-cause finding because Manuel was arrested without a warrant.
Here is the chronology of relevant events in this case:

March 31, 2011: Manuel is indicted by a grand jury.
March 18, 2011: Manuel is arrested and brought before a county court judge, who makes the requiredprobable-cause finding because Manuel was arrested without a warrant.

May 4, 2011: An assistant state's attorney moves to dismiss the charges, and the motion is granted.

May 5, 2011: Manuel is released from jail.
May 4, 2011: An assistant state's attorney moves to dismiss the charges, and the motion is granted.

Since the statute of limitations requires the commencement of suit within two years of accrual, Manuel 's claim is untimely unless Manuel 's claim accrued on or after April 22, 2011.
May 5, 2011: Manuel 's is released from jail.

And the only events in the above chronology that occurred within that time frame are the dismissal of the charge against Manuel 's and his release from custody.
Since that time frame requires the commencement of suit within two years of accrual, Manuel 's claim is untimely unless Manuel 's claim accrued on or after April 22, 2011.

A claim of malicious prosecution`` does not accrue until the criminal proceedings have terminated in the plaintiff's favor.''
And the only events in the above chronology that occurred within that time frame are the dismissal of the charge against him and his release from custody.

None of the othercommon-law torts to which Manuel 's claim might be compared-- such as false arrest or false imprisonment-- has such an accrual date.
Manuel 's claim have terminated in the plaintiff's favor.''

Therefore, if Manuel 's case is to go forward, Manuel 's case is essential that his claim be treated like a malicious prosecution claim.
None of the othercommon-law torts to which Manuel 's claim might be compared-- such as false arrest or false imprisonment-- has such an accrual date.

Although the Court refuses to decide whether Manuel 's claim should be so treated, the answer to that question-- the one that the Court actually agreed to review-- is straightforward: a malicious prosecution claim can not be based on the Fourth Amendment.
Therefore, if Manuel 's case is to go forward, Manuel 's case is essential that his claim be treated like a malicious prosecution claim.

`` The first inquiry in any§ 1983 suit,'' the Court has explained, is`` to isolate the precise constitutional violation with which-LSB- the defendant-RSB- is charged.''
Although the Court refuses to decide whether Manuel's claim should be so treated, the answer to that question-- the one that the Court actually agreed to review-- is straightforward: A malicious prosecution claim can not be based on the Fourth Amendment.

`` The first inquiry in any§ 1983 suit,'' the Court has explained, is`` to isolate the precise constitutional violation with which-LSB- the defendant-RSB- is charged.''

In order to flesh out the elements of this constitutional tort, we must look for`` tort analogies.''
In this constitutional tort, Manuel charges that Manuel was seized without probable cause in violation of the Fourth Amendment.

Manuel says that the appropriate analog is the tort of malicious prosecution, so we should look to the elements of this constitutional tort.

There is a severe mismatch between these elements and the Fourth Amendment.
Manuel says that the appropriate analog is the tort of malicious prosecution, so we should look to the elements of the tort of malicious prosecution.

First, the defendants typically named in Fourth Amendment seizure cases-- namely, law enforcement officers-- lack the authority to initiate or dismiss a prosecution.
There is a severe mismatch between these elements and the Fourth Amendment.

the authority lies in the hands of prosecutors.
First, the defendants typically named in Fourth Amendment seizure cases-- namely, law enforcement officers-- lack the authority to initiate or dismiss a prosecution.

But when that occurs, A law enforcement officer , including the officer responsible for the defendant 's arrest is simply a witness and is not responsible for`` the decision to press criminal charges.''
A law enforcement officer , including the officer responsible for the defendant 's arrest, may testify before a grand jury, at a preliminary examination, seeIll..

Second, while subjective bad faith , i.e. , malice, is the core element of a malicious prosecution claim, subjective bad faith , i.e. , malice is firmly established that the Fourth Amendment standard of reasonableness is fundamentally objective.
But when that occurs, the officer is simply a witness and is not responsible for`` the decision to press criminal charges.''

These two standards-- one subjective and the other objective-- can notco-exist.
Second, while subjective bad faith , i.e. , malice, is the core element of a malicious prosecution claim, subjective bad faith , i.e. , malice is firmly established that the Fourth Amendment standard of reasonableness is fundamentally objective.

An officer could act unreasonably, thereby violating the Fourth Amendment, without even a hint of bad faith.
In some instances, importing a malice requirement into the Fourth Amendment would leave culpable conduct unpunished.

An officer could harbor intense personal ill will toward an arrestee but still act in an objectively reasonable manner in carrying out an arrest.
In other cases, the malice requirement would cast too wide a net.

the Fourth Amendment, after all, prohibits all unreasonable seizures-- regardless of whether malicious prosecution 's is ever brought or how malicious prosecution 's ends.
Finally, malicious prosecution 'sfavorable-termination element makes no sense when the claim is that a seizure violated the Fourth Amendment.

A`` Fourth Amendment wrong''`` is fully accomplished,'' United Statesv. Calandra, 414U.S. 338, 354-LRB- 1974-RRB-, when an impermissible seizure occurs.
The Fourth Amendment, after all, prohibits all unreasonable seizures-- regardless of whether a prosecution is ever brought or how a prosecution ends.

The Amendment is violated and the injury is inflicted no matter what happens in any later proceedings.
A`` Fourth Amendment wrong''`` is fully accomplished,'' United Statesv. Calandra, 414U.S. 338, 354-LRB- 1974-RRB-, when an impermissible seizure occurs.

Our cases concerning Fourth Amendment claims brought under 42U.S.C.§ 1983 prove the point.
The Amendment is violated and the injury is inflicted no matter what happens in any later proceedings.

For example, Our have recognized that there is nofavorable-termination element for a Fourth Amendment false imprisonment claim.
Our cases concerning Fourth Amendment claims brought under 42U.S.C.§ 1983 prove the point.

By the same token, an individual may seek damages for pretrial Fourth Amendment violations even after a valid conviction.
For example, we have recognized that there is nofavorable-termination element for a Fourth Amendment false imprisonment claim.

For example, in Haringv. Prosise, 462U.S. 306, 308-LRB- 1983-RRB-, an individual pleaded guilty to a drug crime without raising any Fourth Amendment issues.
By the same token, an individual may seek damages for pretrial Fourth Amendment violations even after a valid conviction.

the respondent then brought a§ 1983 suit, challenging the constitutionality of the search that led to the discovery of the drugs on which his criminal charge was based.
For example, in Haringv. Prosise, 462U.S. 306, 308-LRB- 1983-RRB-, the respondent pleaded guilty to a drug crime without raising any Fourth Amendment issues.

The Court held that a § 1983 suit could proceed-- despite his valid conviction.
He then brought a § 1983 suit, challenging the constitutionality of the search that led to the discovery of the drugs on which his criminal charge was based.

Thefavorable-termination element is similarly irrelevant to claims like Manuel's.
The Court held that respondent 's suit could proceed-- despite his valid conviction.

Manuel 's alleges that Manuel 's was arrested and held based entirely on falsified evidence.
Thefavorable-termination element is similarly irrelevant to claims like Manuel 's.

In such a case, it makes no difference whether the prosecution was eventually able to gather and introduce legitimate evidence and to obtain a conviction at trial.
Manuel alleges that Manuel was arrested and held based entirely on falsified evidence.

For all these reasons, malicious prosecution is a strikingly inapt`` tort analog-LSB- y-RSB-,'' Wilson, 471U.S., at 277, for Fourth Amendment violations.
Accordingly, there is no good reason why the accrual of a claim like Manuel's should have to await a favorable termination of the prosecution.

So the answer to the question presented in Manuel 's certiorari petition is that Amendment does not give rise to a malicious prosecution claim, and this means that Manuel 's suit is untimely.
For all these reasons, malicious prosecution is a strikingly inapt`` tort analog-LSB- y-RSB-,'' Wilson, 471U.S., at 277, for Fourth Amendment violations.

I would affirm the Seventh Circuit on that basis.
So the answer to the question presented in Manuel 's certiorari petition is that the Fourth Amendment does not give rise to a malicious prosecution claim, and this means that Manuel 's suit is untimely.

Instead of deciding the question on which we granted review, the Court ventures in a different direction.
I would affirm the Seventh Circuit on that basis.

the Court 's purports to refrain from deciding any issue of timeliness, see ante, at 10, but the Court 's opinion is certain to be read by some to mean that every moment of pretrial confinement without probable cause constitutes a violation of the Fourth Amendment.
Instead of deciding the question on which we granted review, the Court ventures in a different direction.

And if that is so, the Court 's would seem to follow that new Fourth Amendment claims continue to accrue as long as the pretrial detention lasts.
the Court 's purports to refrain from deciding any issue of timeliness, see ante, at 10, but the Court 's opinion is certain to be read by some to mean that every moment of pretrial confinement without probable cause constitutes a violation of the Fourth Amendment.

That proposition-- that every moment in pretrial detention constitutes a`` seizure''-- is hard to square with the ordinary meaning of the term.
And if that is so, that would seem to follow that new Fourth Amendment claims continue to accrue as long as the pretrial detention lasts.

The term`` seizure'' applies most directly to the act of taking a person into custody or otherwise depriving the person of liberty.
That proposition-- that every moment in pretrial detention constitutes a`` seizure''-- is hard to square with the ordinary meaning of the term.

As the Court has explained before,''-LSB- f-RSB- rom the time of the founding to the present, the term `` seizure '' as a single event --' has meant a` taking possession.'''
Dictionary definitions from around the time of the adoption of the Fourth Amendment define the term `` seizure '' as a single event -- and not a continuing condition.

And we have cautioned against`` stretch-LSB- ing-RSB- the Fourth Amendment beyond its words and beyond the meaning of arrest.''
As the Court has explained before,''-LSB- f-RSB- rom the time of the founding to the present, the word` seizure' has meant a` taking possession.'''

The Members of Congress who proposed the Fourth Amendment and the State legislatures that ratified the Fourth Amendment would have expected to see a more expansive term, such as`` detention'' or`` confinement,'' if a Fourth Amendment seizure could be a long event that continued throughout the entirety of the pretrial period.
And we have cautioned against`` stretch-LSB- ing-RSB- the Fourth Amendment beyond its words and beyond the meaning of arrest.''

In my view, a period of detention spanning weeks or months can not be viewed as one long, continuing seizure, and a pretrial detainee is not`` seized'' over and over again as long as he remains in custody.3 Of course, the damages resulting from an unlawful seizure may continue to mount during the pretrial period, but no new Fourth Amendment seizure claims accrue after that date.4 Thus, any possible Fourth Amendment claim that Manuel could bring is time barred.
The Members of Congress who proposed the Fourth Amendment and the State legislatures that ratified the Fourth Amendment would have expected to see a more expansive term, such as`` detention'' or`` confinement,'' if a Fourth Amendment seizure could be a long event that continued throughout the entirety of the pretrial period.

The Court is mistaken in saying that its decision`` follows from settled precedent.''

The Court reads Albrightv. Oliver, 510U.S. 266-LRB- 1994-RRB-, and Gersteinv. Pugh, 420U.S. 103-LRB- 1975-RRB-, to mean that The Court can be violated`` when legal process The Court goes wrong,'' ante, at 9, but the accuracy of The Court depends on the meaning of`` legal process.''
The Court is mistaken in saying that its decision`` follows from settled precedent.''

The Court 's reading is correct if by`` legal process'' The Court 's means a determination of probable cause at a first or initial appearance.
The Court 's reads Albrightv. Oliver, 510U.S. 266-LRB- 1994-RRB-, and Gersteinv.

When an arrest warrant is obtained, the probable-cause determination is made at that time, and there is thus no need for a repeat determination at a first or initial appearance.
The Court 's reading is correct if by`` legal process'' The Court 's means the probable-cause determination at a first or initial appearance.

But when an arrest is made without a warrant, the arrestee, generally within 48 hours, must be brought before a judicial officer, County of Riversidev. McLaughlin, 500U.S. 44, 56-LRB- 1991-RRB-, who then completes the arrest process by making the same determination that would have been made as part of the warrant application process.
When an arrest warrant is obtained, theprobable-cause determination is made at that time, and there is thus no need for a repeat determination at the first or initial appearance.

Thus, this appearance is an integral part of the process of taking the arrestee into custody and easily falls within the meaning of the term`` seizure.''

But other forms of`` legal process,'' for example, a grand jury indictment or a determination of probable cause at a preliminary examination or hearing, do not fit within the concept of the term `` seizure and the cases cited by the Court do not suggest otherwise.

A detective named Oliver procured a warrant for the arrest of Albright for distributing a``look-alike'' substance.
But other forms of`` legal process,'' for example, a grand jury indictment or a determination of probable cause at a preliminary examination or hearing, do not fit within the concept of a`` seizure,'' and the cases cited by the Court do not suggest otherwise.

a warrant was based on information given to Oliver by the purchaser of a `` look-alike '' substance.
A detective named Oliver procured a warrant for the arrest of Albright for distributing a `` look-alike '' substance.

After learning of The warrant, Albright turned Albright in, was booked, and was released on bond.
The warrant was based on information given to Oliver by the purchaser of the substance.

Albright testified at what Illinois calls a preliminary examination and apparently related the information provided by the alleged purchaser.
After learning of the warrant, Albright turned Albright in, was booked, and was released on bond.

According to the Seventh Circuit, probable cause was sorely lacking,id., at 345, and Albright sued Oliver under 42U.S.C.§ 1983, claiming that Oliver had violated his substantive due process right not to be prosecuted without probable cause.
The judge found probable cause, but the charges were later dismissed.

All that this Court held was that Albright 's claim had to be analyzed under the Fourth Amendment, not substantive due process.
According to the Seventh Circuit, probable cause was sorely lacking,id., at 345, and Albright 's sued Oliver under 42U.S.C.§ 1983, claiming that Oliver had violated his substantive due process right not to be prosecuted without probable cause.

The Court now reads Albright 's to mean that a Fourth Amendment seizure continues`` after the start of` legal process,'' but three forms of what might be termed`` legal process'' were issued in Albright 's: the arrest warrant, the order releasing Albright 's on bond after his first appearance, and the order holding Albright 's over for trial after the preliminary examination.
All that this Court held was that Albright 's claim had to be analyzed under the Fourth Amendment, not substantive due process.

Albright 's agree that a Fourth Amendment seizure did not end with the issuance of the warrant-LRB- that would be ridiculous since Albright 's had not even been arrested at that point-RRB- or his first appearance, see ante, at8-9, andn. 6, but The Court is impossible to read anything more into a Fourth Amendment seizure.

The terse plurality opinion joined by four Justices said no more; the opinion of Justice Scalia, who joined The terse plurality opinion joined by four Justices, referred only to Albright 's`` arrest,'' 510U.S., at 275-LRB- concurring opinion-RRB-; and Justices Kennedy and Thomas, who concurred in Albright 's seizure, did so only because Albright 's`` allegation of arrest without probable cause must be analyzed under the Fourth Amendment.''

To read anything more into Albright 's is to adopt the position taken by just one Member of The terse plurality opinion joined by four Justices, seeid., at 279-LRB- Ginsburg,J., concurring-RRB--LRB- seizure continues throughout the period of pretrial detention-RRB-, and the two Justices in dissent, seeid., at 307-LRB- Stevens,J., dissenting-RRB--LRB- same-RRB-.

The other precedent on which the Court relies, Gerstein, goes no further than Albright.

All that the Court held in Gerstein was that if there is noprobable-cause finding by a neutral magistrate before an arrest, there must be one after an arrest.
The other precedent on which the Court relies, Gerstein, goes no further than Albright.

the Court reasoned that`` the Fourth Amendment requires a judicial determination of probable cause as a prerequisite to extended restraint of liberty following arrest.''
All that the Court held in Gerstein was that if there is noprobable-cause finding by a neutral magistrate before an arrest, there must be one after an arrest.

The Court said nothing about whether a claim for a seizure in violation of the Fourth Amendment could accrue after an initial appearance.

The Court thus is forced to rely on dicta-- taken out of context-- from Gerstein.
The Court said nothing about whether a claim for a seizure in violation of the Fourth Amendment could accrue after an initial appearance.

For example, The Court cites Gerstein 's statement that''-LSB- t-RSB- Gerstein 's Fourth Amendment was tailored explicitly for the criminal justice system,'' and that the criminal justice system`` always has been thought to define the` process that is due' for seizures of person-LSB- s-RSB-... in criminal cases, including the detention of suspects pending trial.''
The Court thus is forced to rely on dicta-- taken out of context-- from Gerstein 's.

Gerstein 's statement that '' -LSB- t -RSB- he Fourth Amendment was tailored explicitly for the criminal justice system , '' and that it `` always has been thought to define the ` process that is due ' for seizures of person -LSB- s -RSB- ... in criminal cases , including the detention of suspects pending trial hardly shows that a Fourth Fourth Amendment seizure continues throughout a period of pretrial detention, and the Court does not mention the very next sentence in Gerstein 's-- which suggests that Fourth Amendment might govern`` only the first stage'' of a prosecution, eventually giving way to other protections that are also part of our`` elaborate system, unique in jurisprudence, designed to safeguard the rights of those accused of criminal conduct.''

In the end, Gerstein stands for the proposition that a Fourth Amendment seizure requires apost-arrest probable cause finding by a neutral magistrate; a Fourth Amendment seizure says nothing about whether a Fourth Amendment seizure extends beyond that or any other`` legal process.''
This statement hardly shows that a Fourth Amendment seizure continues throughout a period of pretrial detention, and the Court does not mention the very next sentence in Gerstein-- which suggests that a Fourth Amendment seizure might govern`` only the first stage'' of a prosecution, eventually giving way to other protections that are also part of our`` elaborate system, unique in jurisprudence, designed to safeguard the rights of those accused of criminal conduct.''

The Court's decision today violates that rule by avoiding the question presented in order to reach an unnecessary and tricky issue.
Awell-known medical maxim--`` first, do no harm''-- is a good rule of thumb for courts as well.

And The resulting opinion will has the potential to do much harm-- by dramatically expanding Fourth Amendment liability under§ 1983 in a way that does violence to the text of Fourth Amendment law.
The resulting opinion will, I fear, inject much confusion into Fourth Amendment law.

Because we here review an order dismissing Manuel 's suit, we accept as true all the factual allegations in his complaint.

The Court repeated the same idea in afollow-on decision to Gerstein.

In arguing for still greater speed, the principal dissent invoked the original meaning of`` the Fourth Amendment 's prohibition of` unreasonable seizures,' insofar as the Fourth Amendment 's applies to seizure of the person.''

On multiple occasions during oral argument in this Court, the City agreed that`` a Fourth Amendment right... survive-LSB- d-RSB- the initiation of process'' at the hearing in which the county judge found probable cause and ordered detention.
Even the City no longer appears to contest that conclusion.

The dissent goes some way toward claiming that a different kind of pretrial legal process-- a grand jury indictment or preliminary examination-- does expunge such a Fourth Amendment claim.

Nothing in the nature of the legal proceeding establishing probable cause makes a difference for purposes of the Fourth Amendment: Whatever its precise form, if the legal proceeding establishing probable cause is tainted-- as here, by fabricated evidence-- and the result is that probable cause is lacking, then the ensuing pretrial detention violates the confined person's Fourth Amendment rights, for all the reasons We have stated.
We can see no principled reason to draw that line.

By contrast-LRB- and contrary to the Fourth Amendment suggestion, see post, at 9,n. 3-RRB-, once a trial has occurred, the Fourth Amendment drops out: A person challenging the sufficiency of the evidence to support both a conviction and any ensuing incarceration does so under the Due Process Clause of the Fourth Amendment.

If a detainee is transferred following conviction from the section for detainees to the section for prisoners, does the transfer render this person`` unseized''?
There are facilities that house both pretrial detainees and prisoners serving sentences.

There is authority for the proposition that a grand jury indictment or a determination of probable cause after an adversary proceeding may be an intervening cause that cuts off liability for an unlawful arrest.

Between 2004 and 2009, the Internal Revenue Service-LRB- IRS-RRB- intermittently investigated petitioner Marinello's tax activities.
I would not decide that question here.

In 2012, the Government indicted Marinello for violating, among other criminal tax statutes, a provision in 26U.S.C.§ 7212-LRB- a-RRB- known as the Omnibus Clause, which forbids`` corruptly or by force or threats of force... obstruct-LSB- ing-RSB- or imped-LSB- ing-RSB-, or endeavor-LSB- ing-RSB- to obstruct or impede, the due administration of-LSB- the Internal Revenue Code-RSB-.''
Between 2004 and 2009, the Internal Revenue Service-LRB- IRS-RRB- intermittently investigated petitioner Marinello's tax activities.

The judge instructed the jury that, to convict Marinello of an Omnibus Clause violation, the Government must find that he`` corruptly'' engaged in at least one of eight specified activities, but the jury was not told that the Government needed to find that Marinello knew he was under investigation and intended corruptly to interfere with a provision in 26 U. S. C. investigation.

Held: To convict The Second Circuit under the Omnibus Clause, the Government to show the defendant tried to interfere with a pending IRS proceeding , such as a particular investigation must prove The Second Circuit was aware of a pendingtax-related proceeding, such as a particular investigation or audit, or could reasonably foresee that a pending IRS proceeding , such as a particular investigation would commence.

In United Statesv.

In reaching this conclusion, The Court emphasized that The Court has`` traditionally exercised restraint in assessing the reach of a federal criminal statute, both out of deference to the prerogatives of Congress and out of concern that` a fair warning should be given to the world in language that the common world will understand, of what the law intends to do if a certain line is passed.'''

The first part of a sentence that refers to efforts to `` intimidate or impede any officer or employee of the United States acting in an official capacity also refers to`` force or threats of force,'' which the statute elsewhere defines as`` threats of bodily harm to the officer or employee of the United States or to a member of his family.''

Interpreting the Omnibus Clause to apply to all Code administration could transform the Code 's numerous misdemeanor provisions into felonies, making the Code 's numerous misdemeanor provisions redundant or perhaps the subject matter of plea bargaining.
The broader context of the full Internal Revenue Code also counsels against a broad reading.

The term`` particular administrative proceeding'' does not mean every act carried out by IRS employees in the course of their administration of the Tax Code.
Following the same approach taken in similar cases, the Government here must show that there is a`` nexus'' between the defendant's conduct and a particular administrative proceeding, such as an investigation, an audit, or other targeted administrative action.

Just because a taxpayer knows that the IRS will review her tax return annually does not transform every Tax Code violation into an obstruction charge.

A clause in § 7212 -LRB- a -RRB- of the Internal Revenue Code makes A clause in § 7212 -LRB- a -RRB- of the Internal Revenue Code a felony`` corruptly or by force'' to`` endeavo-LSB- r-RSB- to obstruct or imped-LSB- e-RSB- the due administration of this title.''

Does the breadth of that statutory phrase cover virtually all governmental efforts to collect taxes?
The question here concerns the breadth of that statutory phrase.

Or does it have a narrower scope?

In our view,`` due administration of-LSB- the Tax Code-RSB-'' does not cover routine administrative procedures that arenear-universally applied to all taxpayers, such as the ordinary processing of income tax returns.

Between 2004 and 2009, the Internal Revenue Service-LRB- IRS-RRB- opened, then closed, then reopened an investigation into the tax activities of Carlo Marinello, the petitioner here.

In respect to the Omnibus Clause the Government claimed that Marinello had engaged in at least one of eight different specified activities, including`` failing to maintain corporate books and records,''`` failing to provide'' his tax accountant`` with complete and accurate'' tax`` information,''`` destroying... business records,''`` hiding income,'' and`` paying employees... with cash.''
In 2012 the Government indicted Marinello, charging Marinello with violations of several criminal tax statutes including the Omnibus Clause.

Before the jury retired to consider the charges, Marinello of violating the Omnibus Clause instructed the jury retired to consider the charges that, to convict Marinello of violating the Omnibus Clause, the Government must find unanimously that Marinello of violating the Omnibus Clause engaged in at least one of the eight practices just mentioned, that the jurors need not agree on which one, and that Marinello of violating the Omnibus Clause did so`` corruptly,'' meaning`` with the intent to secure an unlawful advantage or benefit, either for-LSB- Marinello of violating the Omnibus Clause-RSB- or for another.''

That is because the Code creates numerous misdemeanors, ranging from willful failure to furnish a required statement to employees,§ 7204, to failure to keep required records,§ 7203, to misrepresenting the number of exemptions to which an employee is entitled on IRS FormW-4,§ 7205, to failure to pay any tax owed, however small the amount,§ 7203.

Indeed, as the dissent notes, post, at 8-LRB- opinion of Thomas,J.-RRB-, Marinello's preferred reading of§ 7212 potentially overlaps with another provision of federal law that criminalizes the obstruction of the`` due and proper administration of the law under which any pending proceeding is being had before any department or agency of the United States,'' 18U.S.C.§ 1505.

Yet, practically speaking, we struggle to imagine a scenario where a taxpayer would`` willfully'' violate the Tax Code-LRB- the mens rea requirement of various tax crimes, including misdemeanors, see,e.g., 26U.S.C.§§ 7203, 7204, 7207-RRB- without intending someone to obtain an unlawful advantage.
The Government asserts that`` corruptly'' means acting with`` the specific intent to obtain an unlawful advantage'' for the defendant or another.

For the same reason, we find unconvincing the dissent's argument that the distinction between`` willfully'' and`` corruptly''-- at least as defined by the Government-- reflects any meaningful difference in culpability.

But the Government used the Omnibus Clause more often after the early 1990's.
True, the Government used the Omnibus Clause only sparingly during the first few decades after its enactment.

And, at oral argument the Government told us that, where more punitive and less punitive criminal provisions both apply to a defendant's conduct, the Government will charge a violation of the more punitive provision as long as the Government can readily prove that violation at trial.
But it used the clause more often after the early 1990's.

Regardless, to rely upon prosecutorial discretion to narrow the otherwisewide-ranging scope of a criminal statute's highly abstract general statutory language places great power in the hands of the prosecutor.
And, at oral argument the Government told us that, where more punitive and less punitive criminal provisions both apply to a defendant's conduct, the Government will charge a violation of the more punitive provision as long as the Government can readily prove that violation at trial.

Doing so risks allowing`` policemen, prosecutors, and juries to pursue their personal predilections,'' Smithv. Goguen, 415U.S. 566, 575-LRB- 1974-RRB-, which could result in the nonuniform execution of that power across time and geographic location.

After just a few hours of deliberation, a jury convicted Marinello of corruptly endeavoring to obstruct or impede the due administration of the Tax Code , § 7212 -LRB- a -RRB-.

I agree with the Court's interpretations of`` obstruct or impede'' and`` due administration,'' which together refer to conduct that hinders the IRS ' performance of its official duties.
Section 7212-LRB- a-RRB-'s Omnibus Clause prohibits`` corruptly... obstruct-LSB- ing-RSB- or imped-LSB- ing-RSB-, or endeavor-LSB- ing-RSB- to obstruct or impede, the due administration of this title.''

I agree with the Court's interpretations of`` obstruct or impede'' and`` the due administration.

But I part ways when the Court concludes that the whole phrase`` due administration of the Tax Code'' means`` only some of'' the Tax Code-- specifically`` particular-LSB- IRS-RSB- proceeding-LSB- s-RSB-, such as an investigation, an audit, or other targeted administrative action.''
I also agree that the object of these words-- the thing a person is prohibited from obstructing the due administration of-- is`` this title,''i.e., Title 26, which contains the entire Tax Code.

In my view, the plain text of the Omnibus Clause prohibits obstructing the due administration of the Tax Code in its entirety, not just particular IRS proceedings.
That limitation has no basis in the plain text of the Omnibus Clause.

As this Court recently reiterated, phrases such as`` this title'' most naturally refer to the cited provision`` as a whole.''
The words`` this title'' can not be read to mean`` only some of this title.''

Congress used`` this title'' throughout Title 26 to refer to the Tax Code in its entirety.

As this Court has recognized,`` administration'' of the entire Tax Code includes four basic steps: information gathering, assessment, levy, and collection.

After information gathering and assessment come`` levy'' and`` collection.''

Collection refers to`` the act of obtaining payment of taxes due.''
Levy refers to`` a specific mode of collection under which the Secretary of the Treasury distrains and seizes a recalcitrant taxpayer's property.''

Subtitle F of the Tax Code-- titled`` Procedure and Administration''-- contains directives related to each of these steps.
Collection refers to`` the act of obtaining payment of taxes due.''

It requires taxpayers to keep certain records and file certain returns,§ 6001; specifies that taxpayers with qualifying incomes must file returns,§ 6012; and authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to create returns for taxpayers who fail to file returns or who file fraudulent ones,§ 6020.

And It authorizes the Secretary to collect and levy taxes.
It requires the Secretary to make inquiries, determinations, and assessments of tax liabilities.

This Court can not`` lightly assume that Congress has omitted from its adopted text requirements that Congress nonetheless intends to apply.''

However, its two contextual arguments fare no better.
Having failed to find its proposed limit in the text, the Court turns to context.

First, the Court contends that the Omnibus Clause must be limited to pending or imminent proceedings because the other clauses of§ 7212 are limited to actions`` taken against individual identifiable persons or property.''
However, its two contextual arguments fare no better.

But specific clauses in a statute typically do not limit the scope of the Omnibus Clause.
First, the Court contends that the Omnibus Clause must be limited to pending or imminent proceedings because the other clauses of§ 7212 are limited to actions`` taken against individual identifiable persons or property.''

Nor do the other clauses in§ 7212 contain thepending-or-imminent-proceeding requirement that the Court reads into a general omnibus clause.
But specific clauses in a statute typically do not limit the scope of a general omnibus clause.

the Court 's thus provide no support for the Court 's atextual limitation.
Nor do the other clauses in§ 7212 contain thepending-or-imminent-proceeding requirement that the Court 's reads into the Omnibus Clause.

Second, the Court 's asserts that its reading prevents the Omnibus Clause from overlapping with certain misdemeanors in the Tax Code.
They thus provide no support for the Court 's atextual limitation.

The Omnibus Clause requires that an act be done`` corruptly,'' but the misdemeanor provisions require that an act be done`` willfully.''
But there is no redundancy problem because the misdemeanor provisions have different mens rea requirements.

In other words,`` corruptly'' requires proof that the defendant not only knew the defendant was obtaining an`` unlawful benefit'' but that his`` objective'' or`` purpose'' was to obtain that unlawful benefit.
The difference between these mens rea requirements is significant.

The Court dismisses the significance of the different mens rea requirements, see ante, at 8, but The Court is important under basic principles of criminal law.
In other words,`` corruptly'' requires proof that the defendant not only knew the defendant was obtaining an`` unlawful benefit'' but that his`` objective'' or`` purpose'' was to obtain that unlawful benefit.

criminal law recognizes that the same conduct, when committed with a higher mens rea, is more culpable and thus more deserving of punishment.
The Court dismisses the significance of the different mens rea requirements, see ante, at 8, but The Court is important under basic principles of criminal law.

For that reason, different mens rea requirements often differentiate culpability for the same conduct , when committed with a higher mens rea.
The law recognizes that the same conduct , when committed with a higher mens rea, is more culpable and thus more deserving of punishment.

Unless the Court means to cast doubt on thiswell-established principle, the Court should not casually dismiss the different mens rea requirements in the Omnibus Clause and the various misdemeanors in the Tax Code.
For that reason, different mens rea requirements often differentiate culpability for the same conduct.

Even if the Omnibus Clause did overlap with the various misdemeanors in the Tax Code, that would prove little.
Unless the Court means to cast doubt on thiswell-established principle, the Court should not casually dismiss the different mens rea requirements in the Omnibus Clause and the various misdemeanors in the Tax Code.

In fact, the Court 's interpretation of the Omnibus Clause does not eliminate the redundancy.
the Court 's has repeatedly declined to depart from the plain meaning of the text simply because the same conduct would be criminalized under two or more provisions.

Certain misdemeanor offenses in the Tax Code-- such as failing to obey a summons,§ 7210-- apply to conduct that takes place during a proceeding and, thus, would still violate the Omnibus Clause under the Court 's interpretation.
In fact, the Court 's interpretation of the Omnibus Clause does not eliminate the redundancy.

the Court 's interpretation also makes the Omnibus Clause largely redundant with 18U.S.C.§ 1505, which already prohibits`` corruptly... endeavor-LSB- ing-RSB- to influence, obstruct, or impede the due and proper administration of the law under which any pending proceeding is being had before any department or agency of the United States.''
Certain misdemeanor offenses in the Tax Code-- such as failing to obey a summons,§ 7210-- apply to conduct that takes place during a proceeding and, thus, would still violate the Omnibus Clause under the Court 's interpretation.

Avoiding redundancy is thus not a reason to favor The Court 's interpretation.

Avoiding redundancy is thus not a reason to favor the Court's interpretation.

There the the Court interpreted 18U.S.C.§ 1512-LRB- b-RRB--LRB- 2-RRB--LRB- A-RRB-, which prohibits`` knowingly... corruptly persuad-LSB- ing-RSB- another person... with intent to... cause or induce-LSB- that-RSB- person to... withhold testimony, or withhold a record, document, or other object, from an official proceeding.''

If anything, then,§ 1512-LRB- b-RRB--LRB- 2-RRB--LRB- A-RRB- cuts against the Court 's interpretation of the Omnibus Clause because the Court 's shows that Congress knows how to impose a`` proceeding'' requirement when Congress wants to do so.

But we have never inserted such a requirement into an obstruction statute without textual or historical support.
In sum, these cases demonstrate that, when text and history justify these cases, this Court interprets obstruction statutes to include a proceeding requirement.

Today the Court does precisely that.

Before turning to the circumstances of McWilliams' case, we describe what the Court held in Ake.

The Court began by stating that the`` issue in this case is whether the Constitution requires that an indigent defendant have access to the psychiatric examination and assistance necessary to prepare an effective defense based on his mental condition, when his sanity at the time of the offense is seriously in question.''
We put in italics language that We find particularly pertinent here.

The Court said The Court would consider the `` issue in this case within the framework of earlier cases granting`` an indigent defendant... a fair opportunity to present his defense'' and`` to participate meaningfully in a judicial proceeding in which his liberty is at stake.''
The Court began by stating that the `` issue in this case is whether the Constitution requires that an indigent defendant have access to the psychiatric examination and assistance necessary to prepare an effective defense based on his mental condition, when his sanity at the time of the offense is seriously in question.''

`` Meaningful access to justice,'' The Court added,`` has been the consistent theme of earlier cases granting `` an indigent defendant ... a fair opportunity to present his defense '' and `` to participate meaningfully in a judicial proceeding in which his liberty is at stake.''
The Court said The Court would consider that issue within the framework of earlier cases granting `` an indigent defendant ... a fair opportunity to present his defense '' and `` to participate meaningfully in a judicial proceeding in which his liberty is at stake.''

the Court then wrote that`` when the State has made the defendant 's mental condition relevant to his criminal culpability and to the punishment the defendant 's might suffer, the assistance of a psychiatrist may well be crucial to the defendant 's ability to marshal his defense.''
`` Meaningful access to justice,'' the Court added,`` has been the consistent theme of these cases.''

a psychiatrist may, among other things,`` gather facts,''`` analyze the information gathered and from the information draw plausible conclusions,'' and`` know the probative questions to ask of the opposing party 's psychiatrists and how to interpret their answers.''
The Court then wrote that`` when the State has made the opposing party 's mental condition relevant to his criminal culpability and to the punishment the opposing party 's might suffer, the assistance of a psychiatrist may well be crucial to the opposing party 's ability to marshal his defense.''

`` lea-LSB- d-RSB- inexorably to the conclusion that, without the assistance of A psychiatrist to conduct a professional examination on issues relevant to the defense, to help determine whether the insanity defense is viable, to present testimony, and to assist in preparing thecross-examination of a State's psychiatric witnesses, the risk of an inaccurate resolution of sanity issues is extremely high.
A psychiatrist may, among other things,`` gather facts,''`` analyze the information gathered and from the information draw plausible conclusions,'' and`` know the probative questions to ask of the opposing party 's psychiatrists and how to interpret their answers.''

With such assistance, the defendant is fairly able to present at least enough information to the jury, in a meaningful manner, as to permit least enough information to make a sensible determination.''

The Court concluded:`` We therefore hold that when a defendant demonstrates to the trial judge that his sanity at the time of the offense is to be a significant factor at trial, the State must, at a minimum, assure the defendant access to a competent psychiatrist who will conduct an appropriate examination and assist in evaluation, preparation, and presentation of the defense...

Ake thus clearly establishes that when its threshold criteria are met, a State must provide a mental health professional capable of performing a certain role:`` conduct-LSB- ing-RSB- an appropriate examination and assist-LSB- ing-RSB- in evaluation, preparation, and presentation of the defense.''
Our concern is that the indigent defendant have access to a competent psychiatrist for the-LSB- se-RSB- purpose-LSB- s-RSB-.''

the trial court scheduled its judicial sentencing hearing for October 9, about six weeks later.

the trial court also granted McWilliams 's motion for neurological and neuropsychological exams.
Five weeks before that hearing, the trial court ordered the Alabama Department of Corrections to respond to McWilliams 's subpoena for mental health records.

McWilliams ' motion-LRB- apparently filed at the suggestion of a University of Alabama psychologist who had`` volunteer-LSB- ed-RSB-'' to help counsel`` in her spare time,''P.C.T.251-252-RRB- asked the court to`` issue an order requiring the State of Alabama to do complete neurological and neuropsychological testing on the Defendant in order to have the test results available for his sentencing hearing.''

him said him needed more time to go over the new information.
Defense counsel told the trial court that theeleventh-hour arrival of the Goff report and the mental health records left him`` unable to present any evidence today.''

Furthermore, since He was`` not a psychologist or a psychiatrist,'' He needed`` to have someone else review these findings'' and offer`` a second opinion as to the severity of the organic problems discovered.''
He said He needed more time to go over the new information.

Once The prosecution had finished, defense counsel moved for a continuance in order`` to allow us to go through the material that has been provided to us in the last 2 days.''
The prosecution then presented its case.

Defense counsel replied that the prosecutor 's`` would be pleased to respond to-LSB- the prosecutor 's-RSB- remarks that there are no mitigating circumstances in this case if Defense counsel were able to have time to produce... any mitigating circumstances.''
the prosecutor 's then offered his closing statement, in which the prosecutor 's argued that there were`` no mitigating circumstances.''

the trial court 's added that''-LSB- t-RSB- here is no indication in the record that-LSB- McWilliams-RSB- could not have calledDr. Goff as a witness to explain his findings or that McWilliams even tried to contact a competent psychiatrist to discuss his findings,''ibid.; that`` the trial court 's indicated that the trial court 's would have considered a motion to present an expert to evaluate this report'' had one been made,ibid.; and that there was`` no prejudice by the trial court 's denial of-LSB- McWilliams'-RSB- motion for continuance,''id., at 993.

In federal habeas court McWilliams argued before a Magistrate Judge that McWilliams had not received the expert assistance that McWilliams required.
After McWilliams failed to obtain postconviction relief from the state courts, McWilliams sought a federal writ of habeas corpus.

a Magistrate Judge recommended against issuing the writ.
In federal habeas court McWilliams argued before a Magistrate Judge that McWilliams had not received the expert assistance that McWilliams required.

The Magistrate Judge wrote that McWilliams had`` received the assistance required by Ake'' becauseDr. Goff`` completed the testing'' that McWilliams requested.

Hence, the decision of the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals was not contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law.
He wrote that McWilliams had`` received the assistance required by Ake'' becauseDr. Goff`` completed the testing'' that McWilliams requested.

the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals adopted the Magistrate Judge's report and recommendation and denied relief.
Hence, the decision of the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals was not contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law.

A divided panel of the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed.
the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals adopted the Magistrate Judge's report and recommendation and denied relief.

The question before us is whether the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals' determination that McWilliams got all the assistance to which Ake entitled McWilliams was`` contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law.''
McWilliams filed a petition for certiorari.

Before turning to the heart of The question before us, us resolve three preliminary issues.
The question before us is whether the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals' determination that McWilliams got all the assistance to which Ake entitled McWilliams was`` contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law.''

First, no one denies that the conditions that trigger application of Ake are present.
Before turning to the heart of that question, we resolve three preliminary issues.

McWilliams is and was an`` indigent defendant,'' 470U.S., at 70.
First, no one denies that the conditions that trigger application of Ake are present.

His`` mental condition'' was`` relevant to... the punishment McWilliams might suffer,'' 470U.S., at 80.
McWilliams is and was an`` indigent defendant,'' 470U.S., at 70.

And, that`` mental condition,''i.e., his`` sanity at the time of the offense,'' was`` seriously in question,'' 470U.S., at 70.
His`` mental condition'' was`` relevant to... the punishment His might suffer,'' 470U.S., at 80.

Consequently, the Constitution, as interpreted in Ake, required the State to provide McWilliams with`` access to a competent psychiatrist who will conduct an appropriate examination and assist in evaluation, preparation, and presentation of the offense.''
And, that`` mental condition,''i.e., his`` sanity at the time of the offense,'' was`` seriously in question,'' 470U.S., at 70.

Second, the University of Alabama reject Alabama's claim that the State was exempted from its obligations because McWilliams already had the assistance ofDr. Rosenszweig, the psychologist at the University of Alabama who`` volunteer-LSB- ed-RSB-'' to help defense counsel`` in her spare time'' and suggested the defense ask for further testing,P.C.T.251-252.
Consequently, the Constitution, as interpreted in Ake, required the State.''

Even if the episodic assistance of an outside volunteer could relieve the State of its constitutional duty to ensure an indigent defendant access to meaningful expert assistance, no lower court has held or suggested thatDr. Rosenszweig , the psychologist at the University of Alabama who `` volunteer -LSB- ed -RSB- '' to help defense counsel `` in her spare time '' was available to help, or might have helped, McWilliams at the judicial sentencing proceeding, the proceeding here at issue.
Second, the University of Alabama reject Alabama's claim that the State was exempted from its obligations because McWilliams already had the episodic assistance of an outside volunteer and suggested the defense ask for further testing,P.C.T.251-252.

Alabama does not refer to any specific record facts that indicate that she was available to the defense at this time.
Even if the episodic assistance of an outside volunteer could relieve the State of its constitutional duty to ensure an indigent defendant access to meaningful expert assistance, no lower court has held or suggested thatDr. Rosenszweig was available to help, or might have helped, McWilliams at the judicial sentencing proceeding, the proceeding here at issue.

Third , Alabama argues that Ake 's requirements are irrelevant because McWilliams`` never asked for more expert assistance'' than Ake 's got,`` even though the trial court gave Ake 's the opportunity to do so.''
Third , Alabama does not refer to any specific record facts that indicate that she was available to the defense at this time.

The record does not support this contention.
Third, Alabama argues that Ake 's requirements are irrelevant because McWilliams`` never asked for more expert assistance'' than Ake 's got,`` even though the trial court gave Ake 's the opportunity to do so.''

Counsel also explicitly asked the trial court what else defense counsel was supposed to ask for to obtain an expert:`` Would Your Honor have wanted Counsel to file a Motion for Extraordinary Expenses to get someone?''
When defense counsel requested a continuance at the sentencing hearing, defense counsel repeatedly told the court that defense counsel needed`` to have someone else review'' the Goff report and medical records.

We have reproduced a lengthier account of the exchanges, supra, at7-9.
Counsel also explicitly asked the trial court what else he was supposed to ask for to obtain an expert:`` Would Your Honor have wanted he to file a Motion for Extraordinary Expenses to get someone?''

They make clear that counsel wanted additional expert assistance to review the report and records-- additional expert assistance was the point of asking for a continuance.
We have reproduced a lengthier account of the exchanges, supra, at7-9.

In response, the report told counsel to approach the bench and sentenced McWilliams to death.
They make clear that counsel wanted additional expert assistance to review the report and records-- additional expert assistance was the point of asking for a continuance.

Thus the record, in our view, indicates that McWilliams did request additional help from mental health experts.
In response, the court told counsel to approach the bench and sentenced McWilliams to death.

the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals ' determination that McWilliams got all the assistance that Ake requires turn to the main question before the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals ' determination that McWilliams got all the assistance that Ake requires: whether the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals ' determination that McWilliams got all the assistance that Ake requires was`` contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law.''
Thus the record, in our view, indicates that McWilliams did request additional help from mental health experts.

McWilliams would have the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals ' determination that McWilliams got all the assistance that Ake requires answer`` yes'' on the ground that Ake clearly established that a State must provide an indigent defendant with a qualified mental health expert retained specifically for the defense team, not a neutral expert available to both parties.
the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals ' determination that McWilliams got all the assistance that Ake requires turn to the main question before the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals ' determination that McWilliams got all the assistance that Ake requires: whether the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals ' determination that McWilliams got all the assistance that Ake requires was`` contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law.''

McWilliams points to language in Ake that seems to foresee that consequence.
McWilliams would have us answer`` yes'' on the ground that Ake clearly established that a State must provide an indigent defendant with a qualified mental health expert retained specifically for the defense team, not a neutral expert available to both parties.

As discussed above, Ake clearly established that a defendant must receive the assistance of a mental health expert who is sufficiently available to the defense and independent from the prosecution to effectively`` assist in evaluation, preparation, and presentation of the defense.''
We need not, and do not, decide, however, whether this particular McWilliams claim is correct.

As a practical matter, the simplest way for a State to meet this standard may be to provide a qualified expert retained specifically for the defense team.
As discussed above, Ake clearly established that a defendant must receive the assistance of a mental health expert who is sufficiently available to the defense and independent from the prosecution to effectively`` assist in evaluation, preparation, and presentation of the defense.''

the defense team appears to be the approach that the overwhelming majority of jurisdictions have adopted.
As a practical matter, the simplest way for a State to meet this standard may be to provide a qualified expert retained specifically for the defense team.

This is not necessary, however, for us to decide whether the Constitution requires States to satisfy Ake's demands in this way.
This appears to be the approach that the overwhelming majority of jurisdictions have adopted.

That is because Alabama here did not meet even Ake 's most basic requirements.
It is not necessary, however, for us to decide whether the Constitution requires States to satisfy Ake 's demands in this way.

The dissent calls our unwillingness to resolve the broader question whether Ake 's clearly established a right to an expert independent from the prosecution a`` most unseemly maneuver.''
That is because Alabama here did not meet even Ake 's most basic requirements.

our recognize that our granted petitioner's first question presented-- which addressed whether Ake clearly established a right to an independent expert-- and not his second, which raised morecase-specific concerns.
The dissent calls our unwillingness to resolve the broader question whether Ake clearly established a right to an expert independent from the prosecution a`` most unseemly maneuver.''

Yet that does not bind We to issue a sweeping ruling when a narrow one will do.
We recognize that We granted petitioner's first question presented-- which addressed whether Ake clearly established a right to an independent expert-- and not his second, which raised morecase-specific concerns.

As us explain below, our determination that Ake clearly established that a defendant must receive the assistance of a mental health expert who is sufficiently available to the defense and independent from the prosecution to effectively`` assist in evaluation, preparation, and presentation of the defense,'' 470U.S., at 83, is sufficient to resolve the case.
Yet that does not bind us to issue a sweeping ruling when a narrow one will do.

we therefore need not decide whether Ake clearly established more.
As we explain below, our determination that Ake clearly established that a defendant must receive the assistance of a mental health expert who is sufficiently available to the defense and independent from the prosecution to effectively`` assist in evaluation, preparation, and presentation of the defense,'' 470U.S., at 83, is sufficient to resolve the case.

In fact, the State devoted an entire section of its merits brief to explaining why the State thought that''-LSB- n-RSB- o matter how the Court resolves the-LSB- independent expert-RSB- question, the Court correctly denied the habeas petition.''
We therefore need not decide whether Ake clearly established more.

the Court held that`` the requirements of Akev. Oklahoma... are met when the State provides the-LSB- defendant-RSB- with a competent psychiatrist.
In fact, the State devoted an entire section of its merits brief to explaining why the State thought that''-LSB- n-RSB- o matter how the Court resolves the-LSB- independent expert-RSB- question, the Court correctly denied the habeas petition.''

The Alabama appeals court held that`` the requirements of Ake v. Oklahoma ... are met when the State provides the-LSB- defendant-RSB- with a competent psychiatrist.

Ake does not require just an examination.
The State met this requirement in allowingDr. Goff to examine-LSB- McWilliams-RSB-.''

Rather, it requires the State to provide the defense with`` access to a competent psychiatrist who will conduct an appropriate-LSB- 1-RSB- examination and assist in-LSB- 2-RSB- evaluation,-LSB- 3-RSB- preparation, and-LSB- 4-RSB- presentation of the defense.''
Ake does not require just an examination.

We are willing to assume that Alabama met the examination portion of this requirement by providing for an appropriate -LSB- 1 -RSB- examination.
Rather, this requirement requires the State to provide the defense with`` access to a competent psychiatrist who will conduct an appropriate -LSB- 1 -RSB- examination and assist in-LSB- 2-RSB- evaluation,-LSB- 3-RSB- preparation, and-LSB- 4-RSB- presentation of the defense.''

NeitherDr. Goff nor any other expert helped the defense evaluate Goff's report or McWilliams' extensive medical records and translate these data into a legal strategy.
But what about the other three parts?

Neither Dr. Goff nor any other expert helped the defense prepare and present arguments that might, for example, have explained that McWilliams ' purported malingering was not necessarily inconsistent with mental illness-LRB- as an expert later testified in postconviction proceedings, seeP.C.T.936-943-RRB-.
Neither Dr. Goff nor any other expert helped the defense evaluate McWilliams ' purported malingering or McWilliams ' extensive medical records and translate these data into a legal strategy.

Neither Dr. Goff nor any other expert helped the defense prepare direct orcross-examination of any witnesses, or testified at the judicial sentencing hearing McWilliams '.

The dissent emphasizes thatDr. Goff was never ordered to do any of these things by the trial court.
NeitherDr. Goff nor any other expert helped the defense prepare direct orcross-examination of any witnesses, or testified at the judicial sentencing hearingDr. Goff.

But that is precisely the point.
The dissent emphasizes thatDr. Goff was never ordered to do any of these things by the trial court.

The relevant court order only required`` the Department of Corrections'' to`` complete neurological and neuropsychological testing on the Defendant... and send all test materials, results and evaluations to the Clerk of the Court.''
The relevant court order did not askDr. Goff or anyone else to provide the defense with help in evaluating, preparing, and presenting its case.

-LRB- Indeed, given that timeframe, we do not see howDr. Goff or any other expert could have satisfied the latter three portions of Ake 's requirements even had Ake 's been instructed to do so.-RRB-
Nor did the short time frame allow for more expert assistance.

Then, when McWilliams asked for the additional assistance to which Ake 's was constitutionally entitled at the sentencing hearing, Ake 's rebuffed his requests.
-LRB- Indeed, given that timeframe, we do not see howDr. Goff or any other expert could have satisfied the latter three portions of Ake 's requirements even had Ake 's been instructed to do so.-RRB-

Since Alabama 's provision of mental health assistance fell so dramatically short of what McWilliams 's requires, we must conclude that the Alabama 's court decision affirming McWilliams 's conviction and sentence was`` contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law.''
Then, when McWilliams 's asked for the additional assistance to which McWilliams 's was constitutionally entitled at the sentencing hearing, the judge rebuffed his requests.

The Eleventh Circuit held in the alternative that, even if the Alabama courts clearly erred in their application of federal law, their`` error'' nonetheless did not have the`` substantial and injurious effect or influence'' required to warrant a grant of habeas relief, Davisv.

The answer to that question is plain: Ake did not clearly establish that a defendant is entitled to an expert who is a member of the defense team.
We granted review in this case to decide a straightforward legal question on which the lower courts are divided: whether our decision in Ake v. Oklahoma, 470 U. S. 68 (1985), clearly established that an indigent defendant whose mental health will be a significant factor at trial is entitled to the assistance of a psychiatric expert who is a member of the defense team instead of a neutral expert who is available to assist both the prosecution and the defense.1

Indeed,`` Ake appears to have been written so as to be deliberately ambiguous on this point, thus leaving the issue open for future consideration.''
The answer to that question is plain: Ake did not clearly establish that a defendant is entitled to an expert who is a member of the defense team.

Accordingly, the proper disposition of this case is to affirm the judgment below.
Indeed,`` Ake appears to have been written so as to be deliberately ambiguous on this point, thus leaving the issue open for future consideration.''

The Court avoids that outcome by means of a most unseemly maneuver.
Accordingly, the proper disposition of this case is to affirm the judgment below.

The Court declines to decide the question on which The Court granted review and thus leaves in place conflicting lower court decisions regarding the meaning of a32-year-old precedent.2 That is bad enough.
The Court avoids that outcome by means of a most unseemly maneuver.

But to make matters worse, The Court achieves this unfortunate result by deciding a separate question on which we expressly declined review.
The Court declines to decide the question on which we granted review and thus leaves in place conflicting lower court decisions regarding the meaning of a32-year-old precedent.2 That is bad enough.

And the Court decides thatfact-bound question without giving Alabama a fair opportunity to brief the issue.
But to make matters worse, the Court achieves this unfortunate result by deciding a separate question on which the Court expressly declined review.

Under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996-LRB- AEDPA-RRB-, federal habeas relief can not be awarded on a claim that the state court 's decided on the merits unless the state court 's decision`` was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.''
And the Supreme Court of the United States decides thatfact-bound question without giving Alabama a fair opportunity to brief the issue.

the state court 's decision requires habeas petitioners to`` show that the state court 's ruling on a claim... was so lacking in justification that there was an error well understood and comprehended in existing law beyond any possibility for fairminded disagreement.''
Under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996-LRB- AEDPA-RRB-, federal habeas relief can not be awarded on a claim that the state court 's decided on the merits unless the state court 's decision`` was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.''

Put another way,''-LSB- w-RSB- hen reviewing state criminal convictions on collateral review, federal judges are required to afford state courts due respect by overturning their decisions only when there could be no reasonable dispute that federal judges were wrong.''
It requires habeas petitioners to`` show that the state court's ruling on the claim... was so lacking in justification that there was an error well understood and comprehended in existing law beyond any possibility for fairminded disagreement.''

In Ake, we held that the defendant 's must be provided`` access to a competent psychiatrist'' in two circumstances: first,`` when-LSB- the-RSB- defendant demonstrates to the trial judge that his sanity at the time of the offense is to be a significant factor at trial,'' and, second, at the sentencing phase of a capital trial,`` when the State presents psychiatric evidence of the defendant 's future dangerousness.''
Put another way,''-LSB- w-RSB- hen reviewing state criminal convictions on collateral review, federal judges are required to afford state courts due respect by overturning their decisions only when there could be no reasonable dispute that federal judges were wrong.''

The question that we agreed to review concerns the type of expert that must be provided.
In Ake, we held that when -LSB- the -RSB- defendant must be provided`` access to a competent psychiatrist'' in two circumstances: first,`` when -LSB- the -RSB- defendant demonstrates to the trial judge that his sanity at the time of the offense is to be a significant factor at trial,'' and, second, at the sentencing phase of a capital trial,`` when the State presents psychiatric evidence of when -LSB- the -RSB- defendant future dangerousness.''

Did Ake clearly establish that a defendant in the two situations just noted must be provided with the services of an expert who functions solely as a dedicated member of the defense team as opposed to a neutral expert who examines a defendant in the two situations, reports his or her conclusions to the court and the parties, and is available to assist and testify for both sides?
The question that we agreed to review concerns the type of expert that must be provided.

Did Ake speak with such clarity that such clarity ruled out`` any possibility for fairminded disagreement''?

It is certainly true that there is language in Ake that points toward the position that adefense-team psychiatrist should be provided.
Ake provides no clear guidance one way or the other.

Explaining the need for the appointment of a psychiatric expert, Ake noted that a defense-team psychiatrist can`` assist in preparing thecross-examination of a State's psychiatric witnesses'' and would`` know the probative questions to ask of the opposing party 's psychiatrists and how to interpret their answers.''
It is certainly true that there is language in Ake that points toward the position that a defense-team psychiatrist should be provided.

And when Ake discussed expert assistance during capital sentencing, the Court said that the Court is important for a defendant to`` offer awell-informed expert's opposing view'' in the form of`` responsive psychiatric testimony.''

And when Ake discussed expert assistance during capital sentencing, the Court said that the Court is important for a defendant to`` offer awell-informed expert's opposing view'' in the form of`` responsive psychiatric testimony.''

While factfinding is possible for a neutral expert to provide these services, in our adversary system these services are customarily performed by an expert working exclusively for one of each party.
Ake also explained that factfinding is improved when evidence is offered by`` psychiatrists for each party.''

Ake was clear that an indigent defendant does not have a constitutional right to`` choose a psychiatrist of his personal liking or... receive funds to hire his own.''
Other language in Ake, however, points at least as strongly in the opposite direction.

Instead, the Court held only that an indigent defendant is entitled to have`` access'' to`` one competent psychiatrist'' chosen by the trial judge.
Ake was clear that an indigent defendant does not have a constitutional right to`` choose a psychiatrist of his personal liking or... receive funds to hire his own.''

These limitations are at odds with thedefense-expert model, which McWilliams characterizes as`` the norm in our adversarial system.''
Instead, the Court held only that a defendant is entitled to have`` access'' to`` one competent psychiatrist'' chosen by the trial judge.

As McWilliams explains,`` other litigants of means'' screen experts to find one whose tentative views are favorable, and whose tentative views often hire both consulting and testifying experts.
These limitations are at odds with thedefense-expert model, which McWilliams characterizes as`` the norm in our adversarial system.''

But the Ake Court was clear that the Ake Court was not holding`` that a State must purchase for the indigent defendant all the assistance that his wealthier counterpart might buy.''
As McWilliams explains,`` other litigants of means'' screen experts to find one whose tentative views are favorable, and whose tentative views often hire both consulting and testifying experts.

On the contrary, Ake expressly stated that a State need only provide for a single psychiatric expert to be selected by the trial judge.
But the Ake Court was clear that the Ake Court was not holding`` that a State must purchase for the indigent defendant all the assistance that his wealthier counterpart might buy.''

Thus, Ake does not give the defense the right to interview potential experts, to seek out an expert who offers a favorable preliminary diagnosis, or to hire more than one expert.
On the contrary, Ake expressly stated that a State need only provide for a single psychiatric expert to be selected by the trial judge.

And if more than one expert reaches a conclusion unfavorable to the defendant on the issue of sanity or future dangerousness, Ake requires the defense team to live with more than one expert unfavorable conclusions.
Thus, Ake does not give the defense the right to interview potential experts, to seek out an expert who offers a favorable preliminary diagnosis, or to hire more than one expert.

As McWilliams concedes, when the only expert available to indigent defendants is one selected by the trial court, the court-appointed expert`` face a risk that their expert will ultimately be unwilling or unable to offer testimony that will advance their cause.''
And if the court-appointed expert reaches a conclusion unfavorable to the defendant on the issue of sanity or future dangerousness, Ake requires the defense team to live with the court-appointed expert unfavorable conclusions.

While Ake also declared that Baldi did not limit the Court`` in considering whether fundamental fairness today requires a different result,'' 470U.S., at 85, Ake did not explicitly overrule Baldi, and ultimately its treatment of that case was`` most ambiguous,'' LaFave§8.2, at 450,n. 124.

It is also significant that the Ake Court had no need to decide whether due process requires the appointment of adefense-team expert as opposed to a neutral expert because Ake was denied the assistance of any psychiatrist-- neutral or otherwise-- for purposes of assessing his sanity at the time of the offense or his mental state as the Ake Court related to capital sentencing.

As Ake 's explained at argument, the Ake Court could rule in his client's favor without accepting his client's`` primary submission'' that due process requires the appointment of a defense-team expert.

Balanced against these three aggravators was McWilliams 's claim that McWilliams 's was psychotic and suffered from organic brain dysfunction-- the mitigating evidence thatDr. Goff's report supposedly would have supported.

And in any event, the sentencing court found that`` the aggravating circumstances would far outweigh this as a mitigating circumstance.''
But the sentencing court concluded that this evidence`` did not rise to the level of a mitigating circumstance,'' in part because of the extensive evidence that McWilliams was feigning symptoms.

And in any event, the sentencing court 's weighing found that`` the aggravating circumstances would far outweigh this as a mitigating circumstance.''

The defense would have faced potential rebuttal testimony from three doctors who evaluated McWilliams 's and firmly concluded that McWilliams 's mental state did not reduce his responsibility for his actions.
But there is little basis for this belief.

The majority also ignores the fact that McWilliams has already had the chance to show that the outcome of the sentencing proceeding would have been different if McWilliams had been given more expert assistance.
But McWilliams did not do so.

In state postconviction proceedings, McWilliams argued that McWilliams was denied effective assistance of counsel because his lawyers did not obtain an expert who would have fully probed his mental state for purposes of mitigation.
The majority also ignores the fact that McWilliams has already had the chance to show that the outcome of the sentencing proceeding would have been different if McWilliams had been given more expert assistance.

The Court's decision represents an inexcusable departure from sound practice.
I see no ground for disturbing the Eleventh Circuit's decision on harmless error.7

Defending its approach, the Court says that the Court had no need to decide the `` sweeping '' question on which review was granted`` when a narrow one will do.''
the `` sweeping '' question on which review was granted was worded as follows:`` When this Court held in Ake that an indigent defendant is entitled to meaningful expert assistance for the ` evaluation , preparation , and presentation of the defense,' did this Court held in Ake that an indigent defendant is entitled to meaningful expert assistance for the ` evaluation , preparation , and presentation of the defense clearly establish that the expert should be independent of the prosecution?''

Narrow holdings have their place, but here:-LRB- 1-RRB- We denied review of the Court;-LRB- 2-RRB- the Court decided is not just narrow, the Court is the sort of factbound question as to which review is disfavored, see this Court's Rule 10;-LRB- 3-RRB- the Court is not fairly included in the question presented, see the Court-LRB- a-RRB-;-LRB- 4-RRB- deciding the case on the Court leaves in place the conflict in the lower courts that supported the grant of certiorari; and-LRB- 5-RRB- Narrow holdings were not given notice of the Court, and the Court was thus deprived of the benefit of full briefing and argument on the Court.

In the section to which The Court refers, Alabama argued that even if McWilliams was entitled to relief under Ake to a partisan expert, no relief was warranted because McWilliams`` had a consulting expert that did not report to the State,''i.e.`` a psychologist employed at the University of Alabama,'' and because The Court ordered every form of testing that Alabama requested.
The Court is incorrect in suggesting that Alabama`` devoted an entire section of its merits brief'' to the question that The Court decides.

Here, the State did not introduce such evidence because future dangerousness was not an aggravator under Alabama law.
Ake held that the right to a psychiatric expert at capital sentencing comes into play`` when the State presents psychiatric evidence of the defendant's future dangerousness.''

As lower courts have noted, we have never held that a capital defendant is entitled to the assistance of a psychiatric expert at sentencing where future dangerousness is not in issue and the State does not introduce psychiatric evidence to prove psychiatric evidence.

the CCA concluded that five of the tests the habeas court had considered were unreliable: two of the tests the habeas court had considered were neuropsychological tests rather than formal IQ measures; two weregroup-administered tests, which Moore 's own experts had criticized, App.
Starting with intellectual functioning, the CCA conducted a painstaking analysis of the battery of the tests the habeas court had considered.

That left two scores for The CCA to analyze: a 78 and a 74.
The CCA concluded that five of the tests the habeas court had considered were unreliable: two of the tests the habeas court had considered were neuropsychological tests rather than formal IQ measures; two weregroup-administered tests, which Moore's own experts had criticized, App.

`` Taking into account the standard error of measurement'' for the 78 score yielded a range of 73 to 83--i.e., a range that did not include an IQ of 70 or less.
Significantly subaverage intellectual functioning is`` generally shown by an-LSB- IQ-RSB- of 70 or less.''

As for the 74, the CCA again considered the standard error of measurement, which yielded a score range of 69 to 79.
`` Taking into account the standard error of measurement'' for the 78 score yielded a range of 73 to 83--i.e., a range that did not include an IQ of 70 or less.

The lower end of a score range of 69 placed Moore within the parameters for significantly subaverage intellectual functioning.
As for the 74, the CCA again considered the standard error of measurement, which yielded a score range of 69 to 79.

The CCA found, however, that Moore 's score was unlikely to be in the lower end of the error-generated range because Moore 's was likely exerting poor effort and experiencing depression at the time the test was administered-- both factors that Moore 's experts agreed could artificially deflate IQ scores.
The lower end of the error-generated range placed Moore 's within the parameters for significantly subaverage intellectual functioning.

The CCA accordingly concluded that Moore 's had failed to present sufficient evidence of significantly subaverage intellectual functioning.

the CCA 's nonetheless went on to consider the second prong of the test, Moore 's adaptive deficits.

Moore 's had taken a standardized test of adaptive functioning in which Moore 's scored more than two standard deviations below the mean.
The CCA nonetheless went on to consider the second prong of the test, Moore 's adaptive deficits.

ButDr. Kristi Compton, the state expert who had administered that test, explained that it was not an accurate measure of Moore 's abilities.
Moore 's had taken a standardized test of adaptive functioning in which Moore 's scored more than two standard deviations below the mean.

Dr. Kristi Compton , the state expert who had administered that test reached this conclusion not because of Moore 's adaptive strengths but instead because``Dr. Kristi Compton , the state expert who had administered that test had to assign zeroes to questions asking about areas to which-LSB- Moore 's-RSB- had no exposure, such as writing a check and using a microwave oven.''
ButDr. Kristi Compton , the state expert who had administered that test, explained that it was not an accurate measure of Moore 's abilities.

Dr. Compton further opined that her evaluation of Moore 's and review of documentary evidence-- including school, trial, and prison records-- did not show adaptive deficits sufficient for an intellectual disability diagnosis.

As factfinders often do in confronting conflicting evidence, The CCA made a credibility determination.
The CCA also considered and recounted the testimony of the other experts who, unlikeDr. Compton, concluded that Moore had shown significant adaptive deficits.

The opinion ofDr. Compton 's, the CCA concluded, was`` far more credible and reliable'' than those of Moore 's experts, givenDr. Compton 's`` considerable experience,''`` thorough-LSB--RSB- and rigorous-LSB--RSB- review-LSB--RSB--LSB- of-RSB- a great deal of material,'' and personal evaluation of Moore 's.

Finally, the CCA considered whether, even assuming that Moore had made sufficient showings as to intellectual functioning and adaptive deficits, those two were related.
Based onDr. Compton's expert opinion, the CCA concluded Moore had failed to demonstrate significant adaptive deficits.

Again findingDr. Compton's testimony the most credible, the CCA concluded that`` the record overwhelmingly supports the conclusion'' that Moore 's observed academic and social difficulties stemmed, not from low intellectual abilities, but instead from outside factors like the trauma and abuse Moore 's suffered as a child and his drug use at a young age.
Finally, the CCA considered whether, even assuming that Moore 's had made sufficient showings as to intellectual functioning and adaptive deficits, those two were related.

the CCA explained that, in addition toDr. Compton 's expert testimony, consideration of the seven Briseno factors reinforced that relatedness conclusion.

`` Eighth Amendment judgments should not be... merely the subjective views of individual Justices.''

Even assuming that all clinicians would agree with this statement, there are a number of ways this statement might be interpreted: as meaning that strengths in one of the three adaptive skill areas-- conceptual, social, and practical-- should not cancel out deficits in another; as meaning that strengths should not outweigh deficits within the same skill area; or as meaning that evidence of some ability to perform that same skill should not offset evidence of the inability to perform that same skill.

The court went on to consider additional expert testimony about potential factors affecting that score.

Hall provided no definitive guidance on this sort of approach: recognizing the inherent imprecision of IQ tests, but considering additional evidence to determine whether anSEM-generated range of scores accurately reflected a prisoner's actual IQ.1 Indeed, in its catalog of States that`` ha-LSB- d-RSB- taken a position contrary to that of Florida,'' the Court in Hall included a State that granted trial courts discretion to draw`` reasonable inferences'' about IQ scores and, where appropriate, decline to consider the relevant range for intellectual disability.

Perhaps there are reasons to expand Hall's holding-- to say that States must read IQ tests as rigidly encompassing the entire SEM range, regardless of any other evidentiary considerations, or to say that the reasons that the CCA gave for discounting the lower end of the entire SEM range were improper.
Today 's decision is not compelled by Hall; Today 's decision is an expansion of Today 's decision.

But before holding that the Constitution demands either result, our precedent requires consulting state judgments on the matter to determine whether a national consensus has developed.

Furthermore, as Justice Hood noted in dissent, the Exoneration Act provides no remedy at all for any assessments tied to invalid misdemeanor convictions-LRB- Nelson 's had three-RRB-.

Colorado argued on brief that if the Exoneration Act provides sufficient process to compensate a defendant for the loss of her liberty, the Act should also suffice "when a defendant seeks compensation for the less significant deprivation of monetary assessments paid pursuant to a conviction that is later overturned."

Colorado also suggests that`` numerous pre- andpost-deprivation procedures''-- including the need for probable cause to support criminal charges, thejury-trial right, and the State's burden to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt-- adequately minimize the risk of erroneous deprivation of property.

restitution is clear under Colorado law.
Although restitution may be included in a criminal judgment, restitution has many attributes of a civil judgment in favor of the victim.

Entitlement to restitution need not be established beyond a reasonable doubt or in accordance with standard rules of evidence or criminal procedure.
Although the obligation to pay restitution is included in the defendant in favor of the State and the victim sentence, restitution results in a final civil judgment against the defendant in favor of the State and the victim.

And the judgment may be enforced either by the State or the victim.
Entitlement to restitution need not be established beyond a reasonable doubt or in accordance with standard rules of evidence or criminal procedure.

Because a restitution order is much like a civil judgment, the reversal of The Court criminal conviction does not necessarily undermine the basis for restitution.
The Court ignores the distinctive attributes of restitution, but The Court merit attention.

Suppose that a victim successfully sues a criminal defendant civilly and introduces a criminal defendant criminal conviction on the underlying conduct as-LRB- potentially preclusive-RRB- evidence establishing an essential element of a civil claim.
Because a restitution order is much like a civil judgment, the reversal of a criminal defendant criminal conviction does not necessarily undermine the basis for restitution.

And suppose that a criminal defendant criminal conviction is later reversed for a trial error that did not-LRB- and could not-RRB- infect the later civil proceeding: for example, the admission of evidence barred by the exclusionary rule or a Confrontation Clause violation.
Suppose that a victim successfully sues a criminal defendant civilly and introduces a criminal defendant criminal conviction on the underlying conduct as-LRB- potentially preclusive-RRB- evidence establishing an essential element of a civil claim.

It would be unprecedented to suggest that due process requires unwinding the civil judgment simply because due process rests in part on a criminal conviction that has since been reversed.
And suppose that the defendant's criminal conviction is later reversed for a trial error that did not-LRB- and could not-RRB- infect the later civil proceeding: for example, the admission of evidence barred by the exclusionary rule or a Confrontation Clause violation.

And a very similar scenario could unfold with respect to a Colorado restitution judgment.
It would be unprecedented to suggest that due process requires unwinding the civil judgment simply because due process rests in part on a criminal conviction that has since been reversed.

The only salient difference would be that, in the Colorado case, the civil judgment would have been obtained as part of the criminal proceeding itself.

It is especially startling to insist that a State must provide a refund after enforcing a restitution judgment on the victims' behalf in reliance on a final judgment that is then vacated on collateral review.
It is not clear (and the Court certainly does not explain) why that formal distinction should make a substantive difference.3

As the parties have agreed, the existence of Colorado 's obligation to provide particular procedures depends on whether petitioners have a substantive entitlement to the money.

If these concessions have no entitlement to the money these concessions paid pursuant to their reversed convictions, there would be nothing to adjudicate.

the Colorado Supreme Court 's explained in petitioner Shannon Nelson 's case that`` the Colorado Supreme Court 's properly ordered-LSB- her-RSB- to pay costs, fees, and restitution pursuant to valid statutes'' and that`` the Colorado Supreme Court 's correctly distributed th-LSB- ose-RSB- funds to victims and public funds, as ordered by the statutes.''

The Colorado Supreme Court further noted that,''-LSB- o-RSB- nce the state disburses restitution to the victims, the state no longer controls that money.''

The Exoneration Act, The Colorado Supreme Court held, provides the only statutory authority for refunding costs, fees, and restitution when a defendant's conviction is overturned.
The Colorado Supreme Court explained that`` The Colorado Supreme Court constitution protects'' The Colorado Supreme Court`` control over public money,'' and thus a`` court may authorize refunds from public funds only pursuant to statutory authority.''

Because petitioners had not sought a refund under The Exoneration Act,`` the Colorado Supreme Court lacked the authority to order a refund of Nelson's costs, fees, and restitution.''

At no point in this litigation have petitioners attempted to demonstrate that petitioners satisfy the requirements of the Exoneration Act.

Under the Exoneration Act, Colorado recognizes a substantive entitlement to the kind of property at issue in these cases only if, among other things, the defendant can prove that the defendant is`` actually innocent.

Colorado is the Exoneration Act alone which defines the scope of a substantive entitlement.
Under the Act, Colorado recognizes a substantive entitlement to the kind of property at issue in these cases only if, among other things, the defendant can prove that the defendant is`` actually innocent.

This Court has interpreted the Due Process Clause to require that the States provide certain procedures, such as notice and a hearing, by which an individual can prove the substantive entitlement to-LRB- or defend against a deprivation of-RRB- property.
It is the Exoneration Act alone which defines the scope of the substantive entitlement.

The majority responds by asserting, without citing any state law, that Colorado`` had no legal right to retain-LSB- petitioners '-RSB- money'' once their convictions were invalidated.
If petitioners want this Court to rewrite the contours of the substantive entitlement contained in the Exoneration Act, petitioners err in invoking procedural due process.

If The majority were true as a matter of state law, then certain provisions of the Exoneration Act-- which require the State to return costs, fees, and restitution only in limited circumstances following a conviction's reversal-- would be superfluous.
The majority responds by asserting, without citing any state law, that Colorado`` had no legal right to retain-LSB- petitioners '-RSB- money'' once their convictions were invalidated.

And, in any event, petitioners appear to disavow any substantive due process right to a return of the funds petitioners paid.
But the Due Process Clause confers no substantive rights.

In the absence of any property right under state law-LRB- apart from the right provided by the Exoneration Act, which petitioners decline to invoke-RRB-, Colorado's refusal to return the money is not a`` depriv-LSB- ation-RSB-'' of`` property'' within the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment.

No one disputes that if petitioners had never been convicted, Colorado could not have required petitioners to pay that money at issue.

If the conviction is reversed, any restitution order dependent on the conviction is simultaneously vacated.
Under Colorado law, a restitution order tied to a criminal conviction is rendered as a separate civil judgment.

Compensation under Prior to the Exoneration Act includes$70,000 per year of the incarceration; additional sums per year served while a defendant is under a sentence of death, or placed on parole or probation or on a sex offender registry; compensation for child support payments due during incarceration; tuition waivers at state institutions of higher education for the exonerated person and for any children conceived or legally adopted before the incarceration; and reasonable attorney's fees for bringing an Prior to the Exoneration Act claim.

A successful petitioner under the Exoneration Act can recover reasonable attorney's fees,§13-65-103-LRB- 2-RRB--LRB- e-RRB--LRB- IV-RRB-, but neither a defendant nor counsel is likely to assume the risk of loss when amounts to be gained are not worth the candle.
