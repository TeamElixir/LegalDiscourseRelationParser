Based on that assurance, Lee accepted a plea and was sentenced to a year and a day in prison.
During the plea process, Lee repeatedly asked his attorney whether he would face deportation; his attorney assured him that he would not be deported as a result of pleading guilty.

Lee had in fact pleaded guilty to an "aggravated felony" under the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U. S. C. ยง1101(a)(43)(B), so he was, contrary to his attorney's advice, subject to mandatory deportation as a result of that plea.
Based on that assurance, Lee accepted a plea and was sentenced to a year and a day in prison.

When Lee learned of this consequence, he filed a motion to vacate his conviction and sentence, arguing that his attorney had provided constitutionally ineffective assistance.

At an evidentiary hearing, both Lee and his plea-stage counsel testified that "deportation was the determinative issue" to Lee in deciding whether to accept a plea, and Lee's counsel acknowledged that although Lee's defense to the charge was weak, if he had known Lee would be deported upon pleading guilty, he would have advised him to go to trial.

Applying the two-part test for ineffective assistance claims from Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668, the Sixth Circuit concluded that, while the Government conceded that Lee's counsel had performed deficiently, Lee could not show that he was prejudiced by his attorney's erroneous advice.

In the unusual circumstances of this case, Lee has adequately demonstrated a reasonable probability that he would have rejected the plea had he known that it would lead to mandatory deportation: Both Lee and his attorney testified that "deportation was the determinative issue" to Lee; his responses during his plea colloquy confirmed the importance he placed on deportation; and he had strong connections to the United States, while he had no ties to South Korea.

But, "[i]n light of the overwhelming evidence of Lee's guilt," Lee "would have almost certainly" been found guilty and received "a significantly longer prison sentence, and subsequent deportation," had he gone to trial.

The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed the denial of relief.
Viewing its resolution of the issue as debatable among jurists of reason, the District Court granted a certificate of appealability.

To establish that he was prejudiced by that deficient performance, the court explained, Lee was required to show "a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's errors, he would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial."
On appeal, the Government conceded that the performance of Lee's attorney had been deficient.

Lee had "no bona fide defense, not even a weak one," so he "stood to gain nothing from going to trial but more prison time."
To establish that he was prejudiced by that deficient performance, the court explained, Lee was required to show "a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's errors, he would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial."

Relying on Circuit precedent holding that "no rational defendant charged with a deportable offense and facing overwhelming evidence of guilt would proceed to trial rather than take a plea deal with a shorter prison sentence," the Court of Appeals concluded that Lee could not show prejudice.
Lee had "no bona fide defense, not even a weak one," so he "stood to gain nothing from going to trial but more prison time."

To demonstrate that counsel was constitutionally ineffective, a defendant must show that counsel's representation "fell below an objective standard of reasonableness" and that he was prejudiced as a result.
The Sixth Amendment guarantees a defendant the effective assistance of counsel at "critical stages of a criminal proceeding," including when he enters a guilty plea.

The first requirement is not at issue in today's case: The Government concedes that Lee's plea-stage counsel provided inadequate representation when he assured Lee that he would not be deported if he pleaded guilty.
To demonstrate that counsel was constitutionally ineffective, a defendant must show that counsel's representation "fell below an objective standard of reasonableness" and that he was prejudiced as a result.

The question is whether Lee can show he was prejudiced by that erroneous advice.
The first requirement is not at issue in today's case: The Government concedes that Lee's plea-stage counsel provided inadequate representation when he assured Lee that he would not be deported if he pleaded guilty.

A defendant raising such a claim can demonstrate prejudice by showing "a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different."
A claim of ineffective assistance of counsel will often involve a claim of attorney error "during the course of a legal proceeding"--for example, that counsel failed to raise an objection at trial or to present an argument on appeal.

But in this case counsel's "deficient performance arguably led not to a judicial proceeding of disputed reliability, but rather to the forfeiture of a proceeding itself."
A defendant raising such a claim can demonstrate prejudice by showing "a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different."

When a defendant alleges his counsel's deficient performance led him to accept a guilty plea rather than go to trial, we do not ask whether, had he gone to trial, the result of that trial "would have been different" than the result of the plea bargain.
But in this case counsel's "deficient performance arguably led not to a judicial proceeding of disputed reliability, but rather to the forfeiture of a proceeding itself."

That is because, while we ordinarily "apply a strong presumption of reliability to judicial proceedings," "we cannot accord" any such presumption "to judicial proceedings that never took place."
When a defendant alleges his counsel's deficient performance led him to accept a guilty plea rather than go to trial, we do not ask whether, had he gone to trial, the result of that trial "would have been different" than the result of the plea bargain.

We instead consider whether the defendant was prejudiced by the "denial of the entire judicial proceeding . . . to which he had a right."
That is because, while we ordinarily "apply a strong presumption of reliability to judicial proceedings," "we cannot accord" any such presumption "to judicial proceedings that never took place."

As we held in Hill v. Lockhart, when a defendant claims that his counsel's deficient performance deprived him of a trial by causing him to accept a plea, the defendant can show prejudice by demonstrating a "reasonable probability that, but for counsel's errors, he would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial."
We instead consider whether the defendant was prejudiced by the "denial of the entire judicial proceeding . . . to which he had a right."

The dissent contends that a defendant must also show that he would have been better off going to trial.

That is true when the defendant's decision about going to trial turns on his prospects of success and those are affected by the attorney's error--for instance, where a defendant alleges that his lawyer should have but did not seek to suppress an improperly obtained confession.
The dissent contends that a defendant must also show that he would have been better off going to trial.

Here Lee knew, correctly, that his prospects of acquittal at trial were grim, and his attorney's error had nothing to do with that.

Rather than asking how a hypothetical trial would have played out absent the error, the Court considered whether there was an adequate showing that the defendant, properly advised, would have opted to go to trial.

Rather than asking how a hypothetical trial would have played out absent the error, the Court considered whether there was an adequate showing that the defendant, properly advised, would have opted to go to trial.

The Court rejected the defendant's claim because he had "alleged no special circumstances that might support the conclusion that he placed particular emphasis on his parole eligibility in deciding whether or not to plead guilty."

Lee insists he would have gambled on trial, risking more jail time for whatever small chance there might be of an acquittal that would let him remain in the United States.2 The Government responds that, since Lee had no viable defense at trial, he would almost certainly have lost and found himself still subject to deportation, with a lengthier prison sentence to boot.

He says he accordingly would have rejected any plea leading to deportation--even if it shaved off prison time--in favor of throwing a "Hail Mary" at trial.
Here Lee alleges that avoiding deportation was the determinative factor for him; deportation after some time in prison was not meaningfully different from deportation after somewhat less time.

Courts should not upset a plea solely because of post hoc assertions from a defendant about how he would have pleaded but for his attorney's deficiencies.

In the unusual circumstances of this case, we conclude that Lee has adequately demonstrated a reasonable probability that he would have rejected the plea had he known that it would lead to mandatory deportation.
Judges should instead look to contemporaneous evidence to substantiate a defendant's expressed preferences.

There is no question that "deportation was the determinative issue in Lee's decision whether to accept the plea deal."
In the unusual circumstances of this case, we conclude that Lee has adequately demonstrated a reasonable probability that he would have rejected the plea had he known that it would lead to mandatory deportation.

Lee asked his attorney repeatedly whether there was any risk of deportation from the proceedings, and both Lee and his attorney testified at the evidentiary hearing below that Lee would have gone to trial if he had known about the deportation consequences.
Report and Recommendation, at 6-7; see also Order, at 14 (noting Government did not dispute testimony to this effect).

Lee demonstrated as much at his plea colloquy: When the judge warned him that a conviction "could result in your being deported," and asked "[d]oes that at all affect your decision about whether you want to plead guilty or not," Lee answered "Yes, Your Honor."
Lee asked his attorney repeatedly whether there was any risk of deportation from the proceedings, and both Lee and his attorney testified at the evidentiary hearing below that Lee would have gone to trial if he had known about the deportation consequences.

Only when Lee's counsel assured him that the judge's statement was a "standard warning" was Lee willing to proceed to plead guilty.

There is no reason to doubt the paramount importance Lee placed on avoiding deportation.
Only when Lee's counsel assured him that the judge's statement was a "standard warning" was Lee willing to proceed to plead guilty.

At the time of his plea, Lee had lived in the United States for nearly three decades, had established two businesses in Tennessee, and was the only family member in the United States who could care for his elderly parents--both naturalized American citizens.
There is no reason to doubt the paramount importance Lee placed on avoiding deportation.

In contrast to these strong connections to the United States, there is no indication that he had any ties to South Korea; he had never returned there since leaving as a child.
At the time of his plea, Lee had lived in the United States for nearly three decades, had established two businesses in Tennessee, and was the only family member in the United States who could care for his elderly parents--both naturalized American citizens.

The Government argues, however, that under Padilla v. Kentucky, a defendant "must convince the court that a decision to reject the plea bargain would have been rational under the circumstances."
In contrast to these strong connections to the United States, there is no indication that he had any ties to South Korea; he had never returned there since leaving as a child.

The Government contends that Lee cannot make that showing because he was going to be deported either way; going to trial would only result in a longer sentence before that inevitable consequence.
The Government argues, however, that under Padilla v. Kentucky, a defendant "must convince the court that a decision to reject the plea bargain would have been rational under the circumstances."

We cannot agree that it would be irrational for a defendant in Lee's position to reject the plea offer in favor of trial.
The Government contends that Lee cannot make that showing because he was going to be deported either way; going to trial would only result in a longer sentence before that inevitable consequence.

But for his attorney's incompetence, Lee would have known that accepting the plea agreement would certainly lead to deportation.
We cannot agree that it would be irrational for a defendant in Lee's position to reject the plea offer in favor of trial.

If deportation were the "determinative issue" for an individual in plea discussions, as it was for Lee; if that individual had strong connections to this country and no other, as did Lee; and if the consequences of taking a chance at trial were not markedly harsher than pleading, as in this case, that "almost" could make all the difference.
But for his attorney's incompetence, Lee would have known that accepting the plea agreement would certainly lead to deportation.

Balanced against holding on to some chance of avoiding deportation was a year or two more of prison time.

on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit

As an initial matter, I remain of the view that the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution does not "requir[e] counsel to provide accurate advice concerning the potential removal consequences of a guilty plea."
Neither the Sixth Amendment nor this Court's precedents support that conclusion.

I would therefore affirm the Court of Appeals on the ground that the Sixth Amendment does not apply to the allegedly ineffective assistance in this case.
As an initial matter, I remain of the view that the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution does not "requir[e] counsel to provide accurate advice concerning the potential removal consequences of a guilty plea."

Because the Court today announces a novel standard for prejudice at the plea stage, I further dissent on the separate ground that its standard does not follow from our precedents.
I would therefore affirm the Court of Appeals on the ground that the Sixth Amendment does not apply to the allegedly ineffective assistance in this case.

The Court and both of the parties agree that the prejudice inquiry in this context is governed by Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668 (1984).
Because the Court today announces a novel standard for prejudice at the plea stage, I further dissent on the separate ground that its standard does not follow from our precedents.

The Court in Strickland held that a defendant may establish a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel by showing that his "counsel's representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness" and, as relevant here, that the representation prejudiced the defendant by "actually ha[ving] an adverse effect on the defense."
The Court and both of the parties agree that the prejudice inquiry in this context is governed by Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668 (1984).

To establish prejudice under Strickland, a defendant must show a "reasonable probability that, but for counsel's unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different."
The Court in Strickland held that a defendant may establish a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel by showing that his "counsel's representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness" and, as relevant here, that the representation prejudiced the defendant by "actually ha[ving] an adverse effect on the defense."

Strickland made clear that the "result of the proceeding" refers to the outcome of the defendant's criminal prosecution as a whole.
To establish prejudice under Strickland, a defendant must show a "reasonable probability that, but for counsel's unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different."

It defined "reasonable probability" as "a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome."

According to Strickland, the "assessment of the likelihood of a result more favorable to the defendant must exclude the possibility of arbitrariness, whimsy, caprice, 'nullification,' and the like."
That conclusion also follows directly from Strickland.

It does not depend on subjective factors such as "the idiosyncrasies of the particular decisionmaker," including the decisionmaker's "unusual propensities toward harshness or leniency."
According to Strickland, the "assessment of the likelihood of a result more favorable to the defendant must exclude the possibility of arbitrariness, whimsy, caprice, 'nullification,' and the like."

These factors are flatly "irrelevant to the prejudice inquiry."
It does not depend on subjective factors such as "the idiosyncrasies of the particular decisionmaker," including the decisionmaker's "unusual propensities toward harshness or leniency."

In other words, "[a] defendant has no entitlement to the luck of a lawless decisionmaker."
These factors are flatly "irrelevant to the prejudice inquiry."

Instead, "[t]he assessment of prejudice should proceed on the assumption that the decisionmaker is reasonably, conscientiously, and impartially applying the standards that govern the decision."
In other words, "[a] defendant has no entitlement to the luck of a lawless decisionmaker."

When the Court extended the right to effective counsel to the plea stage, see Hill v. Lockhart, 474 U. S. 52 (1985), it held that "the same two-part standard" from Strickland applies.
Instead, "[t]he assessment of prejudice should proceed on the assumption that the decisionmaker is reasonably, conscientiously, and impartially applying the standards that govern the decision."

To be sure, the Court said--and the majority today emphasizes--that a defendant asserting an ineffectiveness claim at the plea stage "must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's errors, he would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial."
When the Court extended the right to effective counsel to the plea stage, see Hill v. Lockhart, 474 U. S. 52 (1985), it held that "the same two-part standard" from Strickland applies.

But that requirement merely reflects the reality that a defendant cannot show that the outcome of his case would have been different if he would have accepted his current plea anyway.
To be sure, the Court said--and the majority today emphasizes--that a defendant asserting an ineffectiveness claim at the plea stage "must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's errors, he would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial."

In other words, the defendant's ability to show that he would have gone to trial is necessary, but not sufficient, to establish prejudice.
But that requirement merely reflects the reality that a defendant cannot show that the outcome of his case would have been different if he would have accepted his current plea anyway.

The Hill Court went on to explain that Strickland's two-part test applies the same way in the plea context as in other contexts.
In other words, the defendant's ability to show that he would have gone to trial is necessary, but not sufficient, to establish prejudice.

In particular, the "assessment" will primarily turn on "a prediction whether," in the absence of counsel's error, "the evidence" of the defendant's innocence or guilt "likely would have changed the outcome" of the proceeding.
The Hill Court went on to explain that Strickland's two-part test applies the same way in the plea context as in other contexts.

Thus, a defendant cannot show prejudice where it is " 'inconceivable' " not only that he would have gone to trial, but also " 'that if he had done so he either would have been acquitted or, if convicted, would nevertheless have been given a shorter sentence than he actually received.' "
In particular, the "assessment" will primarily turn on "a prediction whether," in the absence of counsel's error, "the evidence" of the defendant's innocence or guilt "likely would have changed the outcome" of the proceeding.

In sum, the proper inquiry requires a defendant to show both that he would have rejected his plea and gone to trial and that he would likely have obtained a more favorable result in the end.
Thus, a defendant cannot show prejudice where it is " 'inconceivable' " not only that he would have gone to trial, but also " 'that if he had done so he either would have been acquitted or, if convicted, would nevertheless have been given a shorter sentence than he actually received.' "

To the extent Hill was ambiguous about the standard, our precedents applying it confirm this interpretation.
In sum, the proper inquiry requires a defendant to show both that he would have rejected his plea and gone to trial and that he would likely have obtained a more favorable result in the end.

In Premo v. Moore, 562 U. S. 115 (2011), the Court emphasized that "strict adherence to the Strickland standard" is "essential" when reviewing claims about attorney error "at the plea bargain stage."
To the extent Hill was ambiguous about the standard, our precedents applying it confirm this interpretation.

In that case, the defendant argued that his counsel was constitutionally ineffective because he had failed to seek suppression of his confession before he pleaded no contest.
In Premo v. Moore, 562 U. S. 115 (2011), the Court emphasized that "strict adherence to the Strickland standard" is "essential" when reviewing claims about attorney error "at the plea bargain stage."

In analyzing the prejudice issue, the Court did not focus solely on whether the suppression hearing would have turned out differently, or whether the defendant would have chosen to go to trial.
In that case, the defendant argued that his counsel was constitutionally ineffective because he had failed to seek suppression of his confession before he pleaded no contest.

It focused as well on the weight of the evidence against the defendant and the fact that he likely would not have obtained a more favorable result at trial, regardless of whether he succeeded at the suppression hearing.
In analyzing the prejudice issue, the Court did not focus solely on whether the suppression hearing would have turned out differently, or whether the defendant would have chosen to go to trial.

It focused as well on the weight of the evidence against the defendant and the fact that he likely would not have obtained a more favorable result at trial, regardless of whether he succeeded at the suppression hearing.

In that case, the Court extended Hill to hold that counsel could be constitutionally ineffective for failing to communicate a plea deal to a defendant.
The Court in Missouri v. Frye, 566 U. S. 134 (2012), took a similar approach.

The Court emphasized that, in addition to showing a reasonable probability that the defendant "would have accepted the earlier plea offer," it is also "necessary" to show a "reasonable probability that the end result of the criminal process would have been more favorable by reason of a plea to a lesser charge or a sentence of less prison time."
In that case, the Court extended Hill to hold that counsel could be constitutionally ineffective for failing to communicate a plea deal to a defendant.

In short, the Court did not focus solely on whether the defendant would have accepted the plea.
The Court emphasized that, in addition to showing a reasonable probability that the defendant "would have accepted the earlier plea offer," it is also "necessary" to show a "reasonable probability that the end result of the criminal process would have been more favorable by reason of a plea to a lesser charge or a sentence of less prison time."

It instead required the defendant to show that the ultimate outcome would have been different.
In short, the Court did not focus solely on whether the defendant would have accepted the plea.

Finally, the Court's decision in Lafler v. Cooper, 566 U. S. 156 (2012), is to the same effect.
It instead required the defendant to show that the ultimate outcome would have been different.

In that case, the Court concluded that counsel may be constitutionally ineffective by causing a defendant to reject a plea deal he should have accepted.
Finally, the Court's decision in Lafler v. Cooper, 566 U. S. 156 (2012), is to the same effect.

The Court again emphasized that the prejudice inquiry requires a showing that the criminal prosecution would ultimately have ended differently for the defendant--not merely that the defendant would have accepted the deal.
In that case, the Court concluded that counsel may be constitutionally ineffective by causing a defendant to reject a plea deal he should have accepted.

The Court stated that the defendant in those circumstances "must show" a reasonable probability that "the conviction or sentence, or both, under the offer's terms would have been less severe than under the judgment and sentence that in fact were imposed."
The Court again emphasized that the prejudice inquiry requires a showing that the criminal prosecution would ultimately have ended differently for the defendant--not merely that the defendant would have accepted the deal.

The Court stated that the defendant in those circumstances "must show" a reasonable probability that "the conviction or sentence, or both, under the offer's terms would have been less severe than under the judgment and sentence that in fact were imposed."

This Court has held that the right to effective counsel applies to all "critical stages of the criminal proceedings."
These precedents are consistent with our cases governing the right to effective assistance of counsel in other contexts.

Those stages include not only "the entry of a guilty plea," but also "arraignments, postindictment interrogation, [and] postindictment lineups."

Those stages include not only "the entry of a guilty plea," but also "arraignments, postindictment interrogation, [and] postindictment lineups."

It instead has made clear that the prejudice inquiry is the same as in Strickland, which requires a defendant to establish that he would have been better off in the end had his counsel not erred.
In those circumstances, the Court has not held that the prejudice inquiry focuses on whether that stage of the proceeding would have ended differently.

The majority misapplies this Court's precedents when it concludes that a defendant may establish prejudice by showing only that "he would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial," without showing that "the result of that trial would have been different than the result of the plea bargain."
It instead has made clear that the prejudice inquiry is the same as in Strickland, which requires a defendant to establish that he would have been better off in the end had his counsel not erred.

In reaching this conclusion, the Court relies almost exclusively on the single line from Hill that "the defendant must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's errors, he would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial."
The majority misapplies this Court's precedents when it concludes that a defendant may establish prejudice by showing only that "he would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial," without showing that "the result of that trial would have been different than the result of the plea bargain."

For the reasons explained above, that sentence prescribes the threshold showing a defendant must make to establish Strickland prejudice where a defendant has accepted a guilty plea.
In reaching this conclusion, the Court relies almost exclusively on the single line from Hill that "the defendant must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's errors, he would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial."

In Hill, the Court concluded that the defendant had not made that showing, so it rejected his claim.
For the reasons explained above, that sentence prescribes the threshold showing a defendant must make to establish Strickland prejudice where a defendant has accepted a guilty plea.

The Court did not, however, further hold that a defendant can establish prejudice by making that showing alone.
In Hill, the Court concluded that the defendant had not made that showing, so it rejected his claim.

The majority also relies on a case that arises in a completely different context, Roe v. Flores-Ortega, 528 U. S. 470 (2000).
The Court did not, however, further hold that a defendant can establish prejudice by making that showing alone.

There, the Court considered a defendant's claim that his attorney failed to file a notice of appeal.
The majority also relies on a case that arises in a completely different context, Roe v. Flores-Ortega, 528 U. S. 470 (2000).

The Court observed that the lawyer's failure to file the notice of appeal "arguably led not to a judicial proceeding of disputed reliability," but instead to "the forfeiture of a proceeding itself."
There, the Court considered a defendant's claim that his attorney failed to file a notice of appeal.

The Court today observes that petitioner's guilty plea meant that he did not go to trial.
The Court observed that the lawyer's failure to file the notice of appeal "arguably led not to a judicial proceeding of disputed reliability," but instead to "the forfeiture of a proceeding itself."

Because that trial " 'never took place,' " the Court reasons, we cannot " 'apply a strong presumption of reliability' " to it.
The Court today observes that petitioner's guilty plea meant that he did not go to trial.

And because the presumption of reliability does not apply, we may not depend on Strickland's statement "that '[a] defendant has no entitlement to the luck of a lawless decisionmaker.' "
Because that trial " 'never took place,' " the Court reasons, we cannot " 'apply a strong presumption of reliability' " to it.

This point is key to the majority's conclusion that petitioner would have chosen to gamble on a trial even though he had no viable defense.
And because the presumption of reliability does not apply, we may not depend on Strickland's statement "that '[a] defendant has no entitlement to the luck of a lawless decisionmaker.' "

The majority's analysis, however, is directly contrary to Hill, which instructed a court undertaking a prejudice analysis to apply a presumption of reliability to the hypothetical trial that would have occurred had the defendant not pleaded guilty.
This point is key to the majority's conclusion that petitioner would have chosen to gamble on a trial even though he had no viable defense.

After explaining that a court should engage in a predictive inquiry about the likelihood of a defendant securing a better result at trial, the Court said: "As we explained in Strickland v. Washington, supra, these predictions of the outcome at a possible trial, where necessary, should be made objectively, without regard for the 'idiosyncrasies of the particular decisionmaker.' "
The majority's analysis, however, is directly contrary to Hill, which instructed a court undertaking a prejudice analysis to apply a presumption of reliability to the hypothetical trial that would have occurred had the defendant not pleaded guilty.

That quote comes from the same paragraph in Strickland as the discussion about the presumption of reliability that attaches to the trial.

Washington, supra, these predictions of the outcome at a possible trial, where necessary, should be made objectively, without regard for the 'idiosyncrasies of the particular decisionmaker.' "

In other words, Hill instructs that the prejudice inquiry must presume that the foregone trial would have been reliable.
That quote comes from the same paragraph in Strickland as the discussion about the presumption of reliability that attaches to the trial.

The majority responds that Hill made statements about presuming a reliable trial only in "discussing how courts should analyze 'predictions of the outcome at a possible trial,' " which "will not always be 'necessary.' "
In other words, Hill instructs that the prejudice inquiry must presume that the foregone trial would have been reliable.

I agree that such an inquiry is not always necessary--it is not necessary where, as in Hill, the defendant cannot show at the threshold that he would have rejected his plea and chosen to go to trial.
The majority responds that Hill made statements about presuming a reliable trial only in "discussing how courts should analyze 'predictions of the outcome at a possible trial,' " which "will not always be 'necessary.' "

But that caveat says nothing about the application of the presumption of reliability when a defendant can make that threshold showing.
I agree that such an inquiry is not always necessary--it is not necessary where, as in Hill, the defendant cannot show at the threshold that he would have rejected his plea and chosen to go to trial.

In any event, the Court in Hill recognized that guilty pleas are themselves generally reliable.
But that caveat says nothing about the application of the presumption of reliability when a defendant can make that threshold showing.

Guilty pleas "rarely" give rise to the "concern that unfair procedures may have resulted in the conviction of an innocent defendant."
In any event, the Court in Hill recognized that guilty pleas are themselves generally reliable.

That is because "a counseled plea of guilty is an admission of factual guilt so reliable that, where voluntary and intelligent, it quite validly removes the issue of factual guilt from the case."
Guilty pleas "rarely" give rise to the "concern that unfair procedures may have resulted in the conviction of an innocent defendant."

Guilty pleas, like completed trials, are therefore entitled to the protections against collateral attack that the Strickland prejudice standard affords.
That is because "a counseled plea of guilty is an admission of factual guilt so reliable that, where voluntary and intelligent, it quite validly removes the issue of factual guilt from the case."

Finally, the majority does not dispute that the prejudice inquiry in Frye and Lafler focused on whether the defendant established a reasonable probability of a different outcome.
Guilty pleas, like completed trials, are therefore entitled to the protections against collateral attack that the Strickland prejudice standard affords.

The majority instead distinguishes those cases on the ground that they involved a defendant who did not accept a guilty plea.
Finally, the majority does not dispute that the prejudice inquiry in Frye and Lafler focused on whether the defendant established a reasonable probability of a different outcome.

According to the majority, those cases "articulated a different way to show prejudice, suited to the context of pleas not accepted."

But the Court in Frye and Lafler (and Hill, for that matter) did not purport to establish a "different" test for prejudice.

To the contrary, the Court repeatedly stated that it was applying the "same two-part standard" from Strickland.
But the Court in Frye and Lafler (and Hill, for that matter) did not purport to establish a "different" test for prejudice.

It instead concludes that one standard applies when a defendant goes to trial (Strickland); another standard applies when a defendant accepts a plea (Hill); and yet another standard applies when counsel does not apprise the defendant of an available plea or when the defendant rejects a plea (Frye and Lafler).
The majority today abandons any pretense of applying Strickland to claims of ineffective assistance of counsel that arise at the plea stage.

That approach leaves little doubt that the Court has "open[ed] a whole new field of constitutionalized criminal procedure"--"plea-bargaining law"--despite its repeated assurances that it has been applying the same Strickland standard all along.

Petitioner does not dispute that he possessed large quantities of illegal drugs or that the Government had secured a witness who had purchased the drugs directly from him.
Applying the ordinary Strickland standard in this case, I do not think a defendant in petitioner's circumstances could show a reasonable probability that the result of his criminal proceeding would have been different had he not pleaded guilty.

In light of this "overwhelming evidence of . . . guilt," 2014 WL 1260388, *15 (WD Tenn., Mar. 20, 2014), the Court of Appeals concluded that petitioner had "no bona fide defense, not even a weak one," 825 F. 3d 311, 316 (CA6 2016).
Petitioner does not dispute that he possessed large quantities of illegal drugs or that the Government had secured a witness who had purchased the drugs directly from him.

In light of this "overwhelming evidence of . . . guilt," 2014 WL 1260388, *15 (WD Tenn., Mar. 20, 2014), the Court of Appeals concluded that petitioner had "no bona fide defense, not even a weak one," 825 F. 3d 311, 316 (CA6 2016).

As I have explained, however, the Court in Strickland expressly foreclosed relying on the possibility of a "Hail Mary" to establish prejudice.
His only chance of succeeding would have been to "thro[w] a 'Hail Mary' at trial."

Strickland made clear that the prejudice assessment should "proceed on the assumption that the decisionmaker is reasonably, conscientiously, and impartially applying the standards that govern the decision."
As I have explained, however, the Court in Strickland expressly foreclosed relying on the possibility of a "Hail Mary" to establish prejudice.

In the face of overwhelming evidence of guilt and in the absence of a bona fide defense, a reasonable court or jury applying the law to the facts of this case would find the defendant guilty.
Strickland made clear that the prejudice assessment should "proceed on the assumption that the decisionmaker is reasonably, conscientiously, and impartially applying the standards that govern the decision."

There is no reasonable probability of any other verdict.
In the face of overwhelming evidence of guilt and in the absence of a bona fide defense, a reasonable court or jury applying the law to the facts of this case would find the defendant guilty.

He is thus plainly better off for having accepted his plea: had he gone to trial, he not only would have faced the same deportation consequences, he also likely would have received a higher prison sentence.
A defendant in petitioner's shoes, therefore, would have suffered the same deportation consequences regardless of whether he accepted a plea or went to trial.

Finding that petitioner has established prejudice in these circumstances turns Strickland on its head.

This Court has shown special solicitude for the plea process, which brings "stability" and "certainty" to "the criminal justice system."

And we have explained that "[p]rosecutors must have assurance that a plea will not be undone years later," lest they "forgo plea bargains that would benefit defendants," which would be "a result favorable to no one."
The Court has warned that "the prospect of collateral challenges" threatens to undermine these important values.

The Court today provides no assurance that plea deals negotiated in good faith with guilty defendants will remain final.
And we have explained that "[p]rosecutors must have assurance that a plea will not be undone years later," lest they "forgo plea bargains that would benefit defendants," which would be "a result favorable to no one."

For one thing, the Court's artificially cabined standard for prejudice in the plea context is likely to generate a high volume of challenges to existing and future plea agreements.
The Court today provides no assurance that plea deals negotiated in good faith with guilty defendants will remain final.

Under the majority's standard, defendants bringing these challenges will bear a relatively low burden to show prejudice.
For one thing, the Court's artificially cabined standard for prejudice in the plea context is likely to generate a high volume of challenges to existing and future plea agreements.

Whereas a defendant asserting an ordinary claim of ineffective assistance of counsel must prove that the ultimate outcome of his case would have been different, the Court today holds that a defendant who pleaded guilty need show only that he would have rejected his plea and gone to trial.
Under the majority's standard, defendants bringing these challenges will bear a relatively low burden to show prejudice.

This standard does not appear to be particularly demanding, as even a defendant who has only the "smallest chance of success at trial"--relying on nothing more than a " 'Hail Mary' "--may be able to satisfy it.

For another, the Court does not limit its holding to immigration consequences.
This standard does not appear to be particularly demanding, as even a defendant who has only the "smallest chance of success at trial"--relying on nothing more than a " 'Hail Mary' "--may be able to satisfy it.

In addition to undermining finality, the Court's rule will impose significant costs on courts and prosecutors.
Under its rule, so long as a defendant alleges that his counsel omitted or misadvised him on a piece of information during the plea process that he considered of "paramount importance," ante, at 10, he could allege a plausible claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.

Under the Court's standard, a challenge to a guilty plea will be a highly fact-intensive, defendant-specific undertaking.
In addition to undermining finality, the Court's rule will impose significant costs on courts and prosecutors.

Petitioner suggests that each claim will "at least" require a "hearing to get th[e] facts on the table."
Under the Court's standard, a challenge to a guilty plea will be a highly fact-intensive, defendant-specific undertaking.

Given that more than 90 percent of criminal convictions are the result of guilty pleas, Frye, 566 U. S., at 143, the burden of holding evidentiary hearings on these claims could be significant.
Petitioner suggests that each claim will "at least" require a "hearing to get th[e] facts on the table."

For these reasons, I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.
In circumstances where a defendant has admitted his guilt, the evidence against him is overwhelming, and he has no bona fide defense strategy, I see no justification for imposing these costs.

The dissent also relies heavily on Missouri v. Frye, 566 U. S. 134 (2012), and Lafler v. Cooper, 566 U. S. 156 (2012).
For these reasons, I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.

Those cases involved defendants who alleged that, but for their attorney's incompetence, they would have accepted a plea deal--not, as here and as in Hill, that they would have rejected a plea.
The dissent also relies heavily on Missouri v. Frye, 566 U. S. 134 (2012), and Lafler v. Cooper, 566 U. S. 156 (2012).

In both Frye and Lafler, the Court highlighted this difference: Immediately following the sentence that the dissent plucks from Frye, post, at 5 (opinion of Thomas, J.), the Court explained that its "application of Strickland to the instances of an uncommunicated, lapsed plea does nothing to alter the standard laid out in Hill."
Those cases involved defendants who alleged that, but for their attorney's incompetence, they would have accepted a plea deal--not, as here and as in Hill, that they would have rejected a plea.

Lafler, decided the same day as Frye, reiterated that "[i]n contrast to Hill, here the ineffective advice led not to an offer's acceptance but to its rejection."

Frye and Lafler articulated a different way to show prejudice, suited to the context of pleas not accepted, not an additional element to the Hill inquiry.
Lafler, decided the same day as Frye, reiterated that "[i]n contrast to Hill, here the ineffective advice led not to an offer's acceptance but to its rejection."

Contrary to the dissent's assertion, post, at 8-9, we do not depart from Strickland's requirement of prejudice.

The issue is how the required prejudice may be shown.
Contrary to the dissent's assertion, post, at 8-9, we do not depart from Strickland's requirement of prejudice.

Lee also argues that he can show prejudice because, had his attorney advised him that he would be deported if he accepted the Government's plea offer, he would have bargained for a plea deal that did not result in certain deportation.
The issue is how the required prejudice may be shown.

Given our conclusion that Lee can show prejudice based on the reasonable probability that he would have gone to trial, we need not reach this argument.
Lee also argues that he can show prejudice because, had his attorney advised him that he would be deported if he accepted the Government's plea offer, he would have bargained for a plea deal that did not result in certain deportation.

The dissent makes much of the fact that Hill v. Lockhart, 474 U. S. 52 (1985), also noted that courts should ignore the "idiosyncrasies of the particular decisionmaker."
Given our conclusion that Lee can show prejudice based on the reasonable probability that he would have gone to trial, we need not reach this argument.

But Hill made this statement in discussing how courts should analyze "predictions of the outcome at a possible trial."
The dissent makes much of the fact that Hill v. Lockhart, 474 U. S. 52 (1985), also noted that courts should ignore the "idiosyncrasies of the particular decisionmaker."

As we have explained, assessing the effect of some types of attorney errors on defendants' decisionmaking involves such predictions: Where an attorney error allegedly affects how a trial would have played out, we analyze that error's effects on a defendant's decisionmaking by making a prediction of the likely trial outcome.
But Hill made this statement in discussing how courts should analyze "predictions of the outcome at a possible trial."

But, as Hill recognized, such predictions will not always be "necessary."

Such a prediction is neither necessary nor appropriate where, as here, the error is one that is not alleged to be pertinent to a trial outcome, but is instead alleged to have affected a defendant's understanding of the consequences of his guilty plea.
But, as Hill recognized, such predictions will not always be "necessary."

Several courts have noted that a judge's warnings at a plea colloquy may undermine a claim that the defendant was prejudiced by his attorney's misadvice.

The court held a hearing to receive testimony from two psychologists who had examined Madison and prepared reports concerning his competence.

The court's appointed psychologist, Dr. Karl Kirkland, reported that, although Madison may have "suffered a significant decline post-stroke, . . .

Asked at the hearing whether Madison understands that Alabama is seeking retribution against him for his criminal act, Dr. Kirkland answered, "Certainly."

Nevertheless, Dr. Goff found that Madison "is able to understand the nature of the pending proceeding and he has an understanding of what he was tried for"; that he knows he is "in prison . . . because of 'murder' "; that he "understands that . . .

In Dr. Goff's opinion, however, Madison does not "understan[d] the act that . . . he is being punished for" because he cannot recall "the sequence of events from the offense to his arrest to the trial or any of those details" and believes that he "never went around killing folks."

Madison then filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in Federal District Court.
Specifically, it found that Madison understands "that he is going to be executed because of the murder he committed[,] . . . that the State is seeking retribution[,] and that he will die when he is executed."

As a state prisoner, Madison is entitled to federal habeas relief under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA) only if the state trial court's adjudication of his incompetence claim "was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by" this Court, or else was "based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented" in state court.

The District Court denied Madison's petition after concluding that the state court "correctly applied Ford and Panetti" and did not make an "unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence."

In the majority's view, given the undisputed fact that Madison "has no memory of his capital offense," it inescapably follows that he "does not rationally understand the connection between his crime and his execution."
The Eleventh Circuit granted a certificate of appealability and, on appeal, reversed over Judge Jordan's dissent.

On that basis, the Eleventh Circuit held that the trial court's conclusion that Madison is competent to be executed was "plainly unreasonable" and "cannot be reconciled with any reasonable application of Panetti."
In the majority's view, given the undisputed fact that Madison "has no memory of his capital offense," it inescapably follows that he "does not rationally understand the connection between his crime and his execution."

On that basis, the Eleventh Circuit held that the trial court's conclusion that Madison is competent to be executed was "plainly unreasonable" and "cannot be reconciled with any reasonable application of Panetti."

We noted that the retributive purpose of capital punishment is not well served where "the prisoner's mental state is so distorted by a mental illness that his awareness of the crime and punishment has little or no relationship to the understanding of those concepts shared by the community as a whole."
In Panetti, this Court addressed the question whether the Eighth Amendment forbids the execution of a prisoner who lacks "the mental capacity to understand that [he] is being executed as a punishment for a crime."

We noted that the retributive purpose of capital punishment is not well served where "the prisoner's mental state is so distorted by a mental illness that his awareness of the crime and punishment has little or no relationship to the understanding of those concepts shared by the community as a whole."

Neither Panetti nor Ford "clearly established" that a prisoner is incompetent to be executed because of a failure to remember his commission of the crime, as distinct from a failure to rationally comprehend the concepts of crime and punishment as applied in his case.
Similarly, in Ford, we questioned the "retributive value of executing a person who has no comprehension of why he has been singled out."

The state court did not unreasonably apply Panetti and Ford when it determined that Madison is competent to be executed because--notwithstanding his memory loss--he recognizes that he will be put to death as punishment for the murder he was found to have committed.
Neither Panetti nor Ford "clearly established" that a prisoner is incompetent to be executed because of a failure to remember his commission of the crime, as distinct from a failure to rationally comprehend the concepts of crime and punishment as applied in his case.

Testimony from each of the psychologists who examined Madison supported the court's finding that Madison understands both that he was tried and imprisoned for murder and that Alabama will put him to death as punishment for that crime.

Appropriately presented, the issue would warrant full airing.
The issue whether a State may administer the death penalty to a person whose disability leaves him without memory of his commission of a capital offense is a substantial question not yet addressed by the Court.

With that understanding, I join the Court's per curiam disposition of this case.

As a state prisoner, Madison is entitled to federal habeas relief under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA) only if the state trial court's adjudication of his incompetence claim "was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by" this Court, or else was "based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented" in state court.

The District Court denied Madison's petition after concluding that the state court "correctly applied Ford and Panetti" and did not make an "unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence."
A habeas petitioner meets this demanding standard only when he shows that the state court's decision was "so lacking in justification that there was an error well understood and comprehended in existing law beyond any possibility for fairminded disagreement."

The Eleventh Circuit granted a certificate of appealability and, on appeal, reversed over Judge Jordan's dissent.
The District Court denied Madison's petition after concluding that the state court "correctly applied Ford and Panetti" and did not make an "unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence."

In the majority's view, given the undisputed fact that Madison "has no memory of his capital offense," it inescapably follows that he "does not rationally understand the connection between his crime and his execution."
The Eleventh Circuit granted a certificate of appealability and, on appeal, reversed over Judge Jordan's dissent.

On that basis, the Eleventh Circuit held that the trial court's conclusion that Madison is competent to be executed was "plainly unreasonable" and "cannot be reconciled with any reasonable application of Panetti."
In the majority's view, given the undisputed fact that Madison "has no memory of his capital offense," it inescapably follows that he "does not rationally understand the connection between his crime and his execution."

In Panetti, this Court addressed the question whether the Eighth Amendment forbids the execution of a prisoner who lacks "the mental capacity to understand that [he] is being executed as a punishment for a crime."
On that basis, the Eleventh Circuit held that the trial court's conclusion that Madison is competent to be executed was "plainly unreasonable" and "cannot be reconciled with any reasonable application of Panetti."

We noted that the retributive purpose of capital punishment is not well served where "the prisoner's mental state is so distorted by a mental illness that his awareness of the crime and punishment has little or no relationship to the understanding of those concepts shared by the community as a whole."
In Panetti, this Court addressed the question whether the Eighth Amendment forbids the execution of a prisoner who lacks "the mental capacity to understand that [he] is being executed as a punishment for a crime."

Similarly, in Ford, we questioned the "retributive value of executing a person who has no comprehension of why he has been singled out."
We noted that the retributive purpose of capital punishment is not well served where "the prisoner's mental state is so distorted by a mental illness that his awareness of the crime and punishment has little or no relationship to the understanding of those concepts shared by the community as a whole."

Neither Panetti nor Ford "clearly established" that a prisoner is incompetent to be executed because of a failure to remember his commission of the crime, as distinct from a failure to rationally comprehend the concepts of crime and punishment as applied in his case.
Similarly, in Ford, we questioned the "retributive value of executing a person who has no comprehension of why he has been singled out."

The state court did not unreasonably apply Panetti and Ford when it determined that Madison is competent to be executed because--notwithstanding his memory loss--he recognizes that he will be put to death as punishment for the murder he was found to have committed.
Neither Panetti nor Ford "clearly established" that a prisoner is incompetent to be executed because of a failure to remember his commission of the crime, as distinct from a failure to rationally comprehend the concepts of crime and punishment as applied in his case.

Nor was the state court's decision founded on an unreasonable assessment of the evidence before it.
The state court did not unreasonably apply Panetti and Ford when it determined that Madison is competent to be executed because--notwithstanding his memory loss--he recognizes that he will be put to death as punishment for the murder he was found to have committed.

Testimony from each of the psychologists who examined Madison supported the court's finding that Madison understands both that he was tried and imprisoned for murder and that Alabama will put him to death as punishment for that crime.
Nor was the state court's decision founded on an unreasonable assessment of the evidence before it.

In short, the state court's determinations of law and fact were not "so lacking in justification" as to give rise to error "beyond any possibility for fairminded disagreement."
Testimony from each of the psychologists who examined Madison supported the court's finding that Madison understands both that he was tried and imprisoned for murder and that Alabama will put him to death as punishment for that crime.

Under that deferential standard, Madison's claim to federal habeas relief must fail.
In short, the state court's determinations of law and fact were not "so lacking in justification" as to give rise to error "beyond any possibility for fairminded disagreement."

The petition for a writ of certiorari and respondent's motion to proceed in forma pauperis are granted, and the judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed.
We express no view on the merits of the underlying question outside of the AEDPA context.

Appropriately presented, the issue would warrant full airing.
The issue whether a State may administer the death penalty to a person whose disability leaves him without memory of his commission of a capital offense is a substantial question not yet addressed by the Court.

With that understanding, I join the Court's per curiam disposition of this case.
But in this case, the restraints imposed by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, I agree, preclude consideration of the question.

I write separately to underline the fact that this case illustrates one of the basic problems with the administration of the death penalty itself.

That problem concerns the unconscionably long periods of time that prisoners often spend on death row awaiting execution.
I write separately to underline the fact that this case illustrates one of the basic problems with the administration of the death penalty itself.

As I have previously noted, this Court once said that delays in execution can produce uncertainty amounting to " 'one of the most horrible feelings to which' " a prisoner " 'can be subjected.' "
That problem concerns the unconscionably long periods of time that prisoners often spend on death row awaiting execution.

Justice Stevens later observed that the delay in Medley was a delay of four weeks.

In 1987, the average period of imprisonment between death sentence and execution was just over seven years.

Petitioner Keith Tharpe moved to reopen his federal habeas corpus proceedings regarding his claim that the Georgia jury that convicted him of murder included a white juror, Barney Gattie, who was biased against Tharpe because he is black.
Rather than develop a constitutional jurisprudence that focuses upon the special circumstances of the aged, however, I believe it would be wiser to reconsider the root cause of the problem--the constitutionality of the death penalty itself.

The District Court denied the motion on the ground that, among other things, Tharpe's claim was procedurally defaulted in state court.
Petitioner Keith Tharpe moved to reopen his federal habeas corpus proceedings regarding his claim that the Georgia jury that convicted him of murder included a white juror, Barney Gattie, who was biased against Tharpe because he is black.

Tharpe sought a certificate of appealability (COA).

The Eleventh Circuit's decision, as we read it, was based solely on its conclusion, rooted in the state court's factfinding, that Tharpe had failed to show prejudice in connection with his procedurally defaulted claim, i.e., that Tharpe had "failed to demonstrate that Barney Gattie's behavior 'had substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury's verdict.' "
The Eleventh Circuit denied his COA application after deciding that jurists of reason could not dispute that the District Court's procedural ruling was correct.

Our review of the record compels a different conclusion.
The Eleventh Circuit's decision, as we read it, was based solely on its conclusion, rooted in the state court's factfinding, that Tharpe had failed to show prejudice in connection with his procedurally defaulted claim, i.e., that Tharpe had "failed to demonstrate that Barney Gattie's behavior 'had substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury's verdict.' "

And that factual determination is binding on federal courts, including this Court, in the absence of clear and convincing evidence to the contrary.
The state court's prejudice determination rested on its finding that Gattie's vote to impose the death penalty was not based on Tharpe's race.

Niggers"; that Tharpe, "who wasn't in the 'good' black folks category in my book, should get the electric chair for what he did"; that "[s]ome of the jurors voted for death because they felt Tharpe should be an example to other blacks who kill blacks, but that wasn't my reason"; and that, "[a]fter studying the Bible, I have wondered if black people even have souls."
Here, however, Tharpe produced a sworn affidavit, signed by Gattie, indicating Gattie's view that "there are two types of black people: 1.

Gattie's remarkable affidavit--which he never retracted--presents a strong factual basis for the argument that Tharpe's race affected Gattie's vote for a death verdict.

In light of the standard for relief from judgment under Rule 60(b)(6), which is available only in " 'extraordinary circumstances,' " Gonzalez v. Crosby, 545 U. S. 524, 536 (2005), Tharpe faces a high bar in showing that jurists of reason could disagree whether the District Court abused its discretion in denying his motion.

The Court does this to accomplish little more than a do-over in the Court of Appeals: As it concedes, petitioner Keith Tharpe faces a "high bar" on remand to obtain even a certificate of appealability (COA).
In its brief per curiam opinion, the Court misreads a lower court's opinion to find an error that is not there, and then refuses to entertain alternative grounds for affirmance.

One might wonder why the Court engages in this pointless exercise.

The opinions in the affidavit are certainly odious.
The only possible explanation is its concern with the "unusual facts" of this case, specifically a juror affidavit that expresses racist opinions about blacks.

But it involves much more than that.
The Court's terse opinion tells the reader that this case involves a petitioner, a juror, an affidavit, and a prejudice determination.

This case also has a victim, a second affidavit, numerous depositions, factfinding by a state court, and several decisions from federal judges that provide multiple grounds for denying a COA.
But it involves much more than that.

I will briefly provide this omitted context.

After hearing the evidence, the jury needed less than two hours to return a unanimous sentence of death.
A jury convicted Tharpe of malice murder and two counts of aggravated kidnaping.

As aggravating factors, the jury found that Tharpe murdered Freeman while committing two other capital felonies--the aggravated kidnapings of his wife and Freeman--and that the murder was outrageously or wantonly vile, horrible, or inhuman.

Tharpe sought state postconviction relief.

The state court rejected this claim for two reasons.
One of his claims was that "improper racial animus . . . infected the deliberations of the jury."

First, Tharpe could not prove juror misconduct because Georgia law did not allow parties to impeach a jury verdict with post-trial testimony from jurors.
The state court rejected this claim for two reasons.

Second, Tharpe had procedurally defaulted his claim because he had failed to raise it on direct appeal, and he could not establish cause and prejudice to overcome that default.
First, Tharpe could not prove juror misconduct because Georgia law did not allow parties to impeach a jury verdict with post-trial testimony from jurors.

Tharpe's allegation of ineffective assistance of counsel was insufficient to establish cause because he had "failed to establish the requisite deficiency or prejudice."
Second, Tharpe had procedurally defaulted his claim because he had failed to raise it on direct appeal, and he could not establish cause and prejudice to overcome that default.

And Tharpe failed to establish prejudice because the state court credited Gattie's testimony that he had not relied on race when voting to sentence Tharpe.

In June 2017, Tharpe moved to reopen his federal habeas proceedings under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b).

He pointed to this Court's recent decisions in Buck v. Davis, 580 U. S. ___ (2017), and Pena-Rodriguez v. Colorado, 580 U. S. ___ (2017), as extraordinary circumstances that entitled him to relief.

Pena-Rodriguez supplied that new law, Tharpe argued, because it held that a state no-impeachment rule must yield when there is a "clear statement that indicates [a juror] relied on racial stereotypes or animus to convict a criminal defendant."
According to Tharpe, Buck established that extraordinary circumstances are present when a defendant was sentenced due to his race and new law provides an opportunity to consider the merits of his previously defaulted, race-based sentencing claim.

The District Court denied Tharpe's motion.
Pena-Rodriguez supplied that new law, Tharpe argued, because it held that a state no-impeachment rule must yield when there is a "clear statement that indicates [a juror] relied on racial stereotypes or animus to convict a criminal defendant."

It first explained that Pena-Rodriguez announced a new procedural rule that does not apply retroactively on federal collateral review.
The District Court denied Tharpe's motion.

It alternatively deferred to the state court's finding that Tharpe could not prove cause or prejudice to overcome his procedural default.
It first explained that Pena-Rodriguez announced a new procedural rule that does not apply retroactively on federal collateral review.

After the depositions of Gattie and ten other jurors, the state court credited Gattie's testimony that he did not vote for death based on race.
It alternatively deferred to the state court's finding that Tharpe could not prove cause or prejudice to overcome his procedural default.

The District Court deferred to that credibility determination, and nothing in Pena-Rodriguez undermined that determination.
After the depositions of Gattie and ten other jurors, the state court credited Gattie's testimony that he did not vote for death based on race.

It explained that the District Court had concluded in its first decision that Tharpe failed to prove cause and prejudice.
The Eleventh Circuit denied a COA.

The District Court had later rejected Tharpe's Rule 60(b) motion both because Pena-Rodriguez was not retroactively applicable on federal collateral review and because it "presumed the correctness" of the state court's finding that Tharpe failed to " 'establish cause and prejudice.' "
It explained that the District Court had concluded in its first decision that Tharpe failed to prove cause and prejudice.

The Eleventh Circuit then offered two reasons why Tharpe was not entitled to a COA.
The District Court had later rejected Tharpe's Rule 60(b) motion both because Pena-Rodriguez was not retroactively applicable on federal collateral review and because it "presumed the correctness" of the state court's finding that Tharpe failed to " 'establish cause and prejudice.' "

First, Tharpe had not " 'made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.' "
The Eleventh Circuit then offered two reasons why Tharpe was not entitled to a COA.

"As the [state court] and the District Court found, Tharpe failed to demonstrate that Barney Gattie's behavior 'had substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury's verdict.' "
First, Tharpe had not " 'made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.' "

"Nor," the Eleventh Circuit continued, "has Tharpe shown that 'jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling.' "
"As the [state court] and the District Court found, Tharpe failed to demonstrate that Barney Gattie's behavior 'had substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury's verdict.' "

Shortly before his execution, Tharpe filed a petition for a writ of certiorari and a stay application with this Court.
"Nor," the Eleventh Circuit continued, "has Tharpe shown that 'jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling.' "

To obtain a COA, Tharpe must show "that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the petition states a valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right" and "that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling."
Shortly before his execution, Tharpe filed a petition for a writ of certiorari and a stay application with this Court.

The Court is not willing to say that Tharpe can satisfy this standard.
To obtain a COA, Tharpe must show "that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the petition states a valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right" and "that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling."

Instead, its opinion makes two moves.
The Court is not willing to say that Tharpe can satisfy this standard.

First, it "read[s]" the decision below as resting "solely" on Tharpe's "fail[ure] to show prejudice" to overcome his procedural default.
Instead, its opinion makes two moves.

It does not read the decision as reaching cause, and it declines to consider that or any other alternative reason to affirm the Eleventh Circuit.
First, it "read[s]" the decision below as resting "solely" on Tharpe's "fail[ure] to show prejudice" to overcome his procedural default.

Second, the Court holds, contrary to the Eleventh Circuit, that jurists of reason could debate whether Tharpe has proven prejudice.
It does not read the decision as reaching cause, and it declines to consider that or any other alternative reason to affirm the Eleventh Circuit.

The majority misreads the decision below as resting "solely" on prejudice.
Second, the Court holds, contrary to the Eleventh Circuit, that jurists of reason could debate whether Tharpe has proven prejudice.

The Eleventh Circuit addressed cause as well.
The majority misreads the decision below as resting "solely" on prejudice.

The Eleventh Circuit first held that Tharpe had failed to make a " 'substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right,' " explaining that he had "failed to demonstrate that . . . Gattie's behavior 'had substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury's verdict.' "
The Eleventh Circuit addressed cause as well.

Then the Eleventh Circuit alternatively held that Tharpe had not "shown that 'jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling.' "
The Eleventh Circuit first held that Tharpe had failed to make a " 'substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right,' " explaining that he had "failed to demonstrate that . . . Gattie's behavior 'had substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury's verdict.' "

The "procedural ruling" of the District Court rested on both cause and prejudice--as the Eleventh Circuit explained earlier in its opinion, quoting the District Court at length.
Then the Eleventh Circuit alternatively held that Tharpe had not "shown that 'jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling.' "

Indeed, neither party suggests that the Eleventh Circuit's decision did not reach cause, and both parties briefed the issue to this Court.

The Court's reading of the decision below is untenable.

Even if its reading were tenable, the Court does not explain why the strong medicine of a summary disposition is warranted here.

Summary decisions are "rare" and "usually reserved by this Court for situations in which . . . the decision below is clearly in error."

The majority's reading of the decision below is not the better one, much less the clearly correct one.
Summary decisions are "rare" and "usually reserved by this Court for situations in which . . . the decision below is clearly in error."

By adopting the least charitable reading of the Eleventh Circuit's decision, the majority "disrespects the judges of the courts of appeals, who are appointed and confirmed as we are."
The majority's reading of the decision below is not the better one, much less the clearly correct one.

This Court should not "vacate and send back their authorized judgments for inconsequential imperfection of opinion--as though we were schoolmasters grading their homework."
By adopting the least charitable reading of the Eleventh Circuit's decision, the majority "disrespects the judges of the courts of appeals, who are appointed and confirmed as we are."

In fact, "[a]n appropriately self-respecting response to today's summary vacatur would be summary reissuance of the same opinion," ibid., with a sentence clarifying that the Eleventh Circuit agrees with the District Court's decision on cause.

In fact, "[a]n appropriately self-respecting response to today's summary vacatur would be summary reissuance of the same opinion," ibid., with a sentence clarifying that the Eleventh Circuit agrees with the District Court's decision on cause.

The Court acknowledges that our review "is certainly not limited to grounds expressly addressed by the court whose decision is under review."
Putting aside its misreading of the decision below, the Court inexplicably declines to consider alternative grounds for affirmance.

But the Court does not explain why it nonetheless limits itself to the question of prejudice.
The Court acknowledges that our review "is certainly not limited to grounds expressly addressed by the court whose decision is under review."

The Court's self-imposed limitation is inexcusable given that Tharpe's collateral challenges to his sentence have lasted 24 years, the Court's failure to consider alternative grounds has halted an imminent execution, the alternative grounds were reached below, several of them were briefed here, and many of them are obviously correct.
But the Court does not explain why it nonetheless limits itself to the question of prejudice.

In fact, the District Court identified two grounds for denying Tharpe relief that no reasonable jurist could debate.

First, no reasonable jurist could argue that Pena-Rodriguez applies retroactively on collateral review.

Pena-Rodriguez established a new rule: The opinion states that it is answering a question "left open" by this Court's earlier precedents.
First, no reasonable jurist could argue that Pena-Rodriguez applies retroactively on collateral review.

A new rule does not apply retroactively unless it is substantive or a "watershed rul[e] of criminal procedure."
Pena-Rodriguez established a new rule: The opinion states that it is answering a question "left open" by this Court's earlier precedents.

Since Pena-Rodriguez permits a trial court "to consider [certain] evidence," 580 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 17), and does not "alte[r] the range of conduct or the class of persons that the law punishes," Schriro v. Summerlin, 542 U. S. 348, 353 (2004), it cannot be a substantive rule.2 And Tharpe does not even attempt to argue that Pena-Rodriguez established a watershed rule of criminal procedure--a class of rules that is so "narrow" that it is " 'unlikely that any has yet to emerge.' "
A new rule does not apply retroactively unless it is substantive or a "watershed rul[e] of criminal procedure."

Not even the right to have a jury decide a defendant's eligibility for death counts as a watershed rule of criminal procedure.

Second, no reasonable jurist could argue that Tharpe demonstrated cause for his procedural default.
Not even the right to have a jury decide a defendant's eligibility for death counts as a watershed rule of criminal procedure.

The only cause that Tharpe raised in state court was ineffective assistance of counsel.
Second, no reasonable jurist could argue that Tharpe demonstrated cause for his procedural default.

The state court rejected this claim because Tharpe presented only a conclusory allegation to support it.
The only cause that Tharpe raised in state court was ineffective assistance of counsel.

Nor could a reasonable jurist debate the cause argument that Tharpe raises here.
No reasonable jurist could debate that decision.

In his reply brief in support of certiorari in this Court, Tharpe argues that he did not have to raise his claim of juror bias on direct appeal.

But Tharpe never raised this argument in state court, so the state court did not err in failing to accept it.
In his reply brief in support of certiorari in this Court, Tharpe argues that he did not have to raise his claim of juror bias on direct appeal.

Nor did the District Court abuse its discretion in failing to address it, since Tharpe merely mentioned it in a footnote in his reply brief where he was explaining the state court's decision.
But Tharpe never raised this argument in state court, so the state court did not err in failing to accept it.

And even if Tharpe's description of Georgia law is correct and relevant in a federal habeas proceeding, he offers no explanation for why he waited seven years after his trial to obtain Gattie's affidavit.
Nor did the District Court abuse its discretion in failing to address it, since Tharpe merely mentioned it in a footnote in his reply brief where he was explaining the state court's decision.

In short, Tharpe has not offered a viable argument on cause in any court.

On the one issue it does address--prejudice--the Court falters again.
In short, Tharpe has not offered a viable argument on cause in any court.

Its conclusion that reasonable jurists could debate prejudice plows through three levels of deference.

He also denied having sworn to the first affidavit and explained that he had consumed a substantial amount of alcohol on the day he signed it.
Gattie testified in his second affidavit that he did not impose a death sentence because of Tharpe's race.

Gattie's testimony was consistent with the testimony of the other ten jurors deposed in front of the trial court, each of whom testified that they did not consider race and that race was not discussed during their deliberations.

Gattie's testimony was consistent with the testimony of the other ten jurors deposed in front of the trial court, each of whom testified that they did not consider race and that race was not discussed during their deliberations.

It openly anticipates that he will not be able to obtain a COA, which makes sense given the insurmountable barriers he faces on remand.
The Court is cognizant of the weakness of Tharpe's claims.

The Eleventh Circuit also held that Tharpe had not exhausted his Pena-Rodriguez claim in state court.

Moreover, because the state court considered Tharpe's evidence of racial bias anyway, despite Georgia's no-impeachment rule, no reasonable jurist could argue that Pena-Rodriguez presents an extraordinary circumstance that entitles Tharpe to reopen his judgment under Rule 60(b).

Petitioner filed a notice of appeal from this initial judgment.

Petitioner did not file a second notice of appeal from the amended judgment.

When he nonetheless challenged the restitution amount before the Eleventh Circuit, the Government argued that he had forfeited his right to do so by failing to file a second notice of appeal.

The Eleventh Circuit agreed, holding that petitioner could not challenge the restitution amount.
When he nonetheless challenged the restitution amount before the Eleventh Circuit, the Government argued that he had forfeited his right to do so by failing to file a second notice of appeal.

Held: A defendant wishing to appeal an order imposing restitution in a deferred restitution case must file a notice of appeal from that order.

If he fails to do so and the Government objects, he may not challenge the restitution order on appeal.

Here, petitioner filed only one notice of appeal, which preceded by many months the sentence and judgment imposing restitution.

Whether or not the requirement that a defendant file a timely notice of appeal from an amended judgment imposing restitution is a jurisdictional prerequisite, it is at least a mandatory claim-processing rule, which is "unalterable" if raised properly by the party asserting a violation of the rule.
He therefore failed to properly appeal the amended judgment.

Because the Government timely raised the issue, "the court's duty to dismiss the appeal was mandatory."
Whether or not the requirement that a defendant file a timely notice of appeal from an amended judgment imposing restitution is a jurisdictional prerequisite, it is at least a mandatory claim-processing rule, which is "unalterable" if raised properly by the party asserting a violation of the rule.

Petitioner's argument that his single notice of appeal sufficed under the Federal Rules to appeal both judgments depends on two premises: First, in a deferred restitution case, there is only one "judgment," as that term is used in Rules 4(b)(1) and (b)(2); and second, so long as a notice of appeal is filed after the initial judgment, it "springs forward" under Rule 4(b)(2) to appeal the amended judgment imposing restitution.
Because the Government timely raised the issue, "the court's duty to dismiss the appeal was mandatory."

This Court's analysis in Dolan v. United States, 560 U. S. 605, makes clear that deferred restitution cases involve two appealable judgments, not one.

The Dolan Court did not decide the question presented here, but the Court was not persuaded by the argument that "a sentencing judgment is not 'final' until it contains a definitive determination of the amount of restitution."

Instead, the Court recognized, "strong arguments" supported the proposition that both the initial judgment and the restitution order were each immediately appealable final judgments.

Because petitioner's notice of appeal was filed well before the District Court announced the sentence imposing restitution, the notice of appeal did not "spring forward" to become effective on the date the court entered its amended restitution judgment.

on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit

Sentencing courts are required to impose restitution as part of the sentence for specified crimes.
Justice Thomas delivered the opinion of the Court.

But the amount to be imposed is not always known at the time of sentencing.
Sentencing courts are required to impose restitution as part of the sentence for specified crimes.

When that is the case, the court may enter an initial judgment imposing certain aspects of a defendant's sentence, such as a term of imprisonment, while deferring a determination of the amount of restitution until entry of a later, amended judgment.
But the amount to be imposed is not always known at the time of sentencing.

We must decide whether a single notice of appeal, filed between the initial judgment and the amended judgment, is sufficient to invoke appellate review of the later-determined restitution amount.
When that is the case, the court may enter an initial judgment imposing certain aspects of a defendant's sentence, such as a term of imprisonment, while deferring a determination of the amount of restitution until entry of a later, amended judgment.

We hold that it is not, at least where, as here, the Government objects to the defendant's failure to file a notice of appeal following the amended judgment.

After federal agents found more than 300 files containing child pornography on his computer, petitioner Marcelo Manrique pleaded guilty to possessing a visual depiction of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct, in violation of 18 U. S. C. ยงยง2252(a)(4)(B) and (b)(2).

On June 24, 2014, the District Court entered an initial judgment sentencing petitioner to 72 months of imprisonment and a life term of supervised release.
Under the Mandatory Victims Restitution Act of 1996 (MVRA), the District Court was required to order petitioner to "make restitution to the victim of the offense."

At the sentencing hearing, the court acknowledged that restitution was mandatory.
On June 24, 2014, the District Court entered an initial judgment sentencing petitioner to 72 months of imprisonment and a life term of supervised release.

But, consistent with the MVRA, the court postponed determining the victims' damages, which had not yet been ascertained.
At the sentencing hearing, the court acknowledged that restitution was mandatory.

On July 8, petitioner filed a notice of appeal "from the final judgment and sentence entered in this action on the 24th day of June, 2014."
Accordingly, the judgment expressly deferred "determination of restitution" and noted that an "Amended Judgment . . . w[ould] be entered after such determination."

The District Court held a restitution hearing on September 17, 2014.

Only one of the victims sought restitution.
The District Court held a restitution hearing on September 17, 2014.

The court ordered petitioner to pay $4,500 in restitution to her and entered an amended judgment the next day imposing that sentence.
Only one of the victims sought restitution.

Petitioner did not file a second notice of appeal from the court's order imposing restitution or from the amended judgment.
The court ordered petitioner to pay $4,500 in restitution to her and entered an amended judgment the next day imposing that sentence.

Notwithstanding his failure to file a second notice of appeal, petitioner challenged the restitution amount before the Eleventh Circuit, arguing in his brief that the Government had not shown he was the proximate cause of the victim's injuries and that the restitution amount bore no rational relationship to the damages she claimed.
Petitioner did not file a second notice of appeal from the court's order imposing restitution or from the amended judgment.

The Government countered that petitioner had forfeited his right to challenge the restitution amount by failing to file a second notice of appeal.

Filing a notice of appeal transfers adjudicatory authority from the district court to the court of appeals.
To secure appellate review of a judgment or order, a party must file a notice of appeal from that judgment or order.

The statute that governs appeals of criminal sentences, 18 U. S. C. ยง3742(a), provides that a "defendant may file a notice of appeal in the district court for review of an otherwise final sentence" in certain specified circumstances.
Filing a notice of appeal transfers adjudicatory authority from the district court to the court of appeals.

And Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 3(a)(1) specifies that "[a]n appeal permitted by law as of right . . . may be taken only by filing a notice of appeal with the district clerk within the time allowed by Rule 4."
The statute that governs appeals of criminal sentences, 18 U. S. C. ยง3742(a), provides that a "defendant may file a notice of appeal in the district court for review of an otherwise final sentence" in certain specified circumstances.

Both ยง3742(a) and Rule 4 contemplate that the defendant will file the notice of appeal after the district court has decided the issue sought to be appealed.
And Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 3(a)(1) specifies that "[a]n appeal permitted by law as of right . . . may be taken only by filing a notice of appeal with the district clerk within the time allowed by Rule 4."

Section 3742(a)(1) permits the defendant to file a notice of appeal of a sentence that "was imposed in violation of law."
Both ยง3742(a) and Rule 4 contemplate that the defendant will file the notice of appeal after the district court has decided the issue sought to be appealed.

And Rule 4(b)(1)(A)(i) provides generally that, "[i]n a criminal case, a defendant's notice of appeal must be filed in the district court within 14 days after . . . the entry of either the judgment or the order being appealed."
Section 3742(a)(1) permits the defendant to file a notice of appeal of a sentence that "was imposed in violation of law."

Petitioner filed only one notice of appeal, which preceded by many months the sentence and judgment imposing restitution.
And Rule 4(b)(1)(A)(i) provides generally that, "[i]n a criminal case, a defendant's notice of appeal must be filed in the district court within 14 days after . . . the entry of either the judgment or the order being appealed."

His notice of appeal could not have been "for review" of the restitution order, ยง3742(a), and it was not filed within the timeframe allowed by Rule 4.
Petitioner filed only one notice of appeal, which preceded by many months the sentence and judgment imposing restitution.

He thus failed to properly appeal under the statute and the Rules the amended judgment imposing restitution.
His notice of appeal could not have been "for review" of the restitution order, ยง3742(a), and it was not filed within the timeframe allowed by Rule 4.

The Government contends that filing a notice of appeal from the judgment imposing restitution is a jurisdictional prerequisite to securing appellate review of the restitution amount.
He thus failed to properly appeal under the statute and the Rules the amended judgment imposing restitution.

This position follows, according to the Government, from many of our cases emphasizing the "jurisdictional significance" of a notice of appeal.
The Government contends that filing a notice of appeal from the judgment imposing restitution is a jurisdictional prerequisite to securing appellate review of the restitution amount.

Because the notice of appeal is jurisdictional, the Government explains, the Court of Appeals was required to dismiss petitioner's appeal regardless of whether the Government raised the issue.

Mandatory claim-processing rules "seek to promote the orderly progress of litigation by requiring that the parties take certain procedural steps at certain specified times."
The requirement that a defendant file a timely notice of appeal from an amended judgment imposing restitution is at least a mandatory claim-processing rule.

Unlike jurisdictional rules, mandatory claim-processing rules may be forfeited "if the party asserting the rule waits too long to raise the point."
Mandatory claim-processing rules "seek to promote the orderly progress of litigation by requiring that the parties take certain procedural steps at certain specified times."

The Government timely raised petitioner's failure to file a notice of appeal from the amended judgment imposing restitution before the Court of Appeals.
Unlike jurisdictional rules, mandatory claim-processing rules may be forfeited "if the party asserting the rule waits too long to raise the point."

Accordingly, "the court's duty to dismiss the appeal was mandatory."
The Government timely raised petitioner's failure to file a notice of appeal from the amended judgment imposing restitution before the Court of Appeals.

Petitioner disputes this conclusion, arguing that his single notice of appeal sufficed under the Rules to appeal both the initial judgment and the amended judgment imposing restitution.
Accordingly, "the court's duty to dismiss the appeal was mandatory."

As we understand it, his argument depends on two premises: First, in a deferred restitution case, there is only one "judgment," as that term is used in Rules 4(b)(1) and (b)(2); and second, so long as a notice of appeal is filed after the initial judgment, it "springs forward" under Rule 4(b)(2) to appeal the amended judgment imposing restitution.
Petitioner disputes this conclusion, arguing that his single notice of appeal sufficed under the Rules to appeal both the initial judgment and the amended judgment imposing restitution.

Petitioner argues that the initial judgment deferring restitution and the amended judgment imposing a specific restitution amount merge to become "the judgment" referenced in the Federal Rules.
We reject each of these premises.

He argues that his notice of appeal, which was filed within 14 days of the initial judgment, was therefore sufficient to invoke appellate review of the merged judgment.
Petitioner argues that the initial judgment deferring restitution and the amended judgment imposing a specific restitution amount merge to become "the judgment" referenced in the Federal Rules.

Petitioner's approach is inconsistent with our reasoning in Dolan, 560 U. S. 605.
He argues that his notice of appeal, which was filed within 14 days of the initial judgment, was therefore sufficient to invoke appellate review of the merged judgment.

The petitioner in that case argued that the amended judgment imposing restitution is the only final, appealable judgment in a deferred restitution case.
Petitioner's approach is inconsistent with our reasoning in Dolan, 560 U. S. 605.

Although we did not decide "whether or when a party can, or must, appeal"--the question presented here--we were not persuaded by the argument that "a sentencing judgment is not 'final' until it contains a definitive determination of the amount of restitution."
The petitioner in that case argued that the amended judgment imposing restitution is the only final, appealable judgment in a deferred restitution case.

To the contrary, we recognized "strong arguments" supporting the proposition that both the "initial judgment [that] imposed a sentence of imprisonment and supervised release" and the subsequent " 'sentence that impose[d] an order of restitution' " were each immediately appealable final judgments.
Although we did not decide "whether or when a party can, or must, appeal"--the question presented here--we were not persuaded by the argument that "a sentencing judgment is not 'final' until it contains a definitive determination of the amount of restitution."

Consequently, we were not surprised "to find instances where a defendant ha[d] appealed from the entry of a judgment containing an initial sentence that includes a term of imprisonment" and "subsequently appealed from a later order setting forth the final amount of restitution."
To the contrary, we recognized "strong arguments" supporting the proposition that both the "initial judgment [that] imposed a sentence of imprisonment and supervised release" and the subsequent " 'sentence that impose[d] an order of restitution' " were each immediately appealable final judgments.

Our analysis in Dolan thus makes clear that deferred restitution cases involve two appealable judgments, not one.1
Consequently, we were not surprised "to find instances where a defendant ha[d] appealed from the entry of a judgment containing an initial sentence that includes a term of imprisonment" and "subsequently appealed from a later order setting forth the final amount of restitution."

Petitioner's reliance on Rule 4(b)(2) is also misplaced.
Our analysis in Dolan thus makes clear that deferred restitution cases involve two appealable judgments, not one.1

That Rule provides that a "notice of appeal filed after the court announces a decision, sentence, or order--but before the entry of the judgment or order--is treated as filed on the date of and after the entry."
Petitioner's reliance on Rule 4(b)(2) is also misplaced.

A prematurely filed notice of appeal will become effective under the Rule to challenge a later-entered judgment in some circumstances.
That Rule provides that a "notice of appeal filed after the court announces a decision, sentence, or order--but before the entry of the judgment or order--is treated as filed on the date of and after the entry."

As this Court explained in construing Rule 4(a)(2)'s parallel provision for civil cases, the Rule "was intended to protect the unskilled litigant who files a notice of appeal from a decision that he reasonably but mistakenly believes to be a final judgment, while failing to file a notice of appeal from the actual final judgment."
A prematurely filed notice of appeal will become effective under the Rule to challenge a later-entered judgment in some circumstances.

By its own terms, however, Rule 4(b)(2) applies only to a notice of appeal filed after a sentence has been "announce[d]" and before the judgment imposing the sentence is entered on the docket.

If the court has not yet decided the issue that the appellant seeks to appeal, then the Rule does not come into play.
By its own terms, however, Rule 4(b)(2) applies only to a notice of appeal filed after a sentence has been "announce[d]" and before the judgment imposing the sentence is entered on the docket.

Accordingly, it does not apply where a district court enters an initial judgment deferring restitution and subsequently amends the judgment to include the sentence of restitution.
If the court has not yet decided the issue that the appellant seeks to appeal, then the Rule does not come into play.

By deferring restitution, the court is declining to announce a sentence.
Accordingly, it does not apply where a district court enters an initial judgment deferring restitution and subsequently amends the judgment to include the sentence of restitution.

When petitioner filed his notice of appeal in this case, the District Court had observed only that restitution was "mandatory."
By deferring restitution, the court is declining to announce a sentence.

The court did not announce the restitution amount (or even hold a hearing on the issue) until months later.
When petitioner filed his notice of appeal in this case, the District Court had observed only that restitution was "mandatory."

Even if describing restitution as mandatory could qualify as a "sentence" that the District Court "announced" under Rule 4(b)(2), petitioner has never disputed that restitution is mandatory for his offense.
The court did not announce the restitution amount (or even hold a hearing on the issue) until months later.

Rather, he argued on appeal that the amount of the restitution imposed--an issue the court did not consider until months later--is unlawful.
Even if describing restitution as mandatory could qualify as a "sentence" that the District Court "announced" under Rule 4(b)(2), petitioner has never disputed that restitution is mandatory for his offense.

Because petitioner's notice of appeal was filed well before the District Court announced the sentence imposing $4,500 in restitution, the notice of appeal did not "spring forward" to become effective on the date the court entered its amended judgment imposing that sentence.
Rather, he argued on appeal that the amount of the restitution imposed--an issue the court did not consider until months later--is unlawful.

Finally, petitioner argues in the alternative that any defect in his notice of appeal should be overlooked as harmless error, citing Lemke v. United States, 346 U. S. 325 (1953) (per curiam).
Because petitioner's notice of appeal was filed well before the District Court announced the sentence imposing $4,500 in restitution, the notice of appeal did not "spring forward" to become effective on the date the court entered its amended judgment imposing that sentence.

In that case, the petitioner filed a notice of appeal the day after his sentence was announced but three days before the judgment was entered.
Finally, petitioner argues in the alternative that any defect in his notice of appeal should be overlooked as harmless error, citing Lemke v. United States, 346 U. S. 325 (1953) (per curiam).

His notice of appeal was dismissed as premature under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 37(a)(2), which then governed notices of appeal in criminal cases.
In that case, the petitioner filed a notice of appeal the day after his sentence was announced but three days before the judgment was entered.

This Court reversed on the ground that the premature filing was harmless error under Rule 52(a).
His notice of appeal was dismissed as premature under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 37(a)(2), which then governed notices of appeal in criminal cases.

The Court's holding in Lemke does not apply to petitioner's failure to file a notice of appeal from the amended judgment.

Lemke has been superseded by the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure in two ways.
The Court's holding in Lemke does not apply to petitioner's failure to file a notice of appeal from the amended judgment.

First, the Lemke petitioner's notice of appeal would now be timely under Rule 4(b)(2).
Lemke has been superseded by the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure in two ways.

As discussed in Part II-B-2, supra, petitioner here cannot take advantage of that rule.
First, the Lemke petitioner's notice of appeal would now be timely under Rule 4(b)(2).

Second, Rule 3(a)(2) now provides the consequences for litigant errors associated with filing a notice of appeal.
As discussed in Part II-B-2, supra, petitioner here cannot take advantage of that rule.

The court of appeals may, in its discretion, overlook defects in a notice of appeal other than the failure to timely file a notice.
Second, Rule 3(a)(2) now provides the consequences for litigant errors associated with filing a notice of appeal.

It may not overlook the failure to file a notice of appeal at all.
The court of appeals may, in its discretion, overlook defects in a notice of appeal other than the failure to timely file a notice.

The filing of a notice of appeal from an amended judgment imposing restitution is at least a mandatory claim-processing rule, Part II-A, supra, meaning that the requirement to file such a notice is unalterable, so long as the opposing party raises the issue.
It may not overlook the failure to file a notice of appeal at all.

By definition, mandatory claim-processing rules, although subject to forfeiture, are not subject to harmless-error analysis.
The filing of a notice of appeal from an amended judgment imposing restitution is at least a mandatory claim-processing rule, Part II-A, supra, meaning that the requirement to file such a notice is unalterable, so long as the opposing party raises the issue.

Petitioner in this case did not file a defective notice of appeal from the amended judgment imposing restitution, but rather failed altogether to file a notice of appeal from the amended judgment.
By definition, mandatory claim-processing rules, although subject to forfeiture, are not subject to harmless-error analysis.

Because petitioner failed to do so, and the Government objected, the Court of Appeals properly declined to consider his challenge to the amount of restitution imposed.
We hold that a defendant who wishes to appeal an order imposing restitution in a deferred restitution case must file a notice of appeal from that order.

The judgment of the Court of Appeals, accordingly, is affirmed.

Justice Gorsuch took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.
The judgment of the Court of Appeals, accordingly, is affirmed.

Justice Ginsburg, with whom Justice Sotomayor joins, dissenting.
on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit

That matter is settled, and the Court, today, leaves undisturbed prior opinions distinguishing claim-processing rules from jurisdictional orders.
Time limits, such as those stated in Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure 3 and 4, and other limitations prescribed in a procedural rule, this Court has held, are claim-processing rules, not jurisdictional requirements.

As I see it, a defendant wishing to appeal his sentence and conviction when a restitution determination has been deferred has two choices: (1) He may immediately appeal his conviction and sentence of imprisonment, and later appeal the restitution order when made; or (2) he may await the restitution order and then appeal, through a single notice, his conviction, sentence of imprisonment, and restitution order.
That matter is settled, and the Court, today, leaves undisturbed prior opinions distinguishing claim-processing rules from jurisdictional orders.

But even assuming, arguendo, that separate appeal notices are ordinarily required, I would hold that Manrique is not barred from appealing the restitution order in the circumstances of this case.

After sentencing--regardless of the defendant's plea--the court must advise the defendant of any right to appeal the sentence."
Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32(j)(1)(B) states:

The District Court gave Manrique the requisite advice upon sentencing him to imprisonment on June 23, 2014, see App.
After sentencing--regardless of the defendant's plea--the court must advise the defendant of any right to appeal the sentence."

The Government agrees that the District Court was "absolutely" required to advise Manrique of his right to appeal the restitution order, and anticipates that the required advice "will prevent cases like this from arising again in the future."
The District Court gave Manrique the requisite advice upon sentencing him to imprisonment on June 23, 2014, see App.

Aware of its obligation to advise Manrique of his right to appeal, the District Court appears to have assumed that no second notice was required to place the restitution amount before the Court of Appeals.
The Government agrees that the District Court was "absolutely" required to advise Manrique of his right to appeal the restitution order, and anticipates that the required advice "will prevent cases like this from arising again in the future."

Without awaiting another appeal notice, the District Court clerk transmitted the amended judgment, five days after its entry, to the Court of Appeals, which filed that judgment on the docket of the appeal from the conviction and sentence already pending in that court.
Aware of its obligation to advise Manrique of his right to appeal, the District Court appears to have assumed that no second notice was required to place the restitution amount before the Court of Appeals.

In turn, the Eleventh Circuit's clerk asked the District Court reporter to send up the transcript of, and record from, the restitution hearing.
Without awaiting another appeal notice, the District Court clerk transmitted the amended judgment, five days after its entry, to the Court of Appeals, which filed that judgment on the docket of the appeal from the conviction and sentence already pending in that court.

In light of what occurred here, I would hold that the clerk's dispatch of the amended judgment to the Court of Appeals "confer[red] jurisdiction on the court of appeals."

In light of what occurred here, I would hold that the clerk's dispatch of the amended judgment to the Court of Appeals "confer[red] jurisdiction on the court of appeals."

Because I would treat the clerk's transmission of the amended judgment as tantamount to, or effectively doing service for, a second appeal notice, I would reverse the Eleventh Circuit's judgment and allow Manrique to include the restitution order in his appeal.
In other words, in lieu of trapping an unwary defendant, see Tr.

We do not intend to call into question this Court's decision in Corey v. United States, 375 U. S. 169, 176 (1963) (holding that a defendant may challenge his conviction after a single notice of appeal filed from a final sentence imposed under ยง4208(b)).
Because I would treat the clerk's transmission of the amended judgment as tantamount to, or effectively doing service for, a second appeal notice, I would reverse the Eleventh Circuit's judgment and allow Manrique to include the restitution order in his appeal.

Given the steps taken by the District Court, Court of Appeals, and the clerks of those courts, it was likely no surprise to the Government when Manrique challenged the restitution award in his opening brief on appeal.

During a traffic stop, police officers in Joliet, Illinois, searched petitioner Elijah Manuel and found a vitamin bottle containing pills.
Given the steps taken by the District Court, Court of Appeals, and the clerks of those courts, it was likely no surprise to the Government when Manrique challenged the restitution award in his opening brief on appeal.

Suspecting the pills to be illegal drugs, the officers conducted a field test, which came back negative for any controlled substance.
During a traffic stop, police officers in Joliet, Illinois, searched petitioner Elijah Manuel and found a vitamin bottle containing pills.

Still, they arrested Manuel and took him to the police station.
Suspecting the pills to be illegal drugs, the officers conducted a field test, which came back negative for any controlled substance.

An arresting officer also reported that, based on his "training and experience," he "knew the pills to be ecstasy."
There, an evidence technician tested the pills and got the same negative result, but claimed in his report that one of the pills tested "positive for the probable presence of ecstasy."

On the basis of those false statements, another officer filed a sworn complaint charging Manuel with unlawful possession of a controlled substance.
An arresting officer also reported that, based on his "training and experience," he "knew the pills to be ecstasy."

Relying exclusively on that complaint, a county court judge found probable cause to detain Manuel pending trial.
On the basis of those false statements, another officer filed a sworn complaint charging Manuel with unlawful possession of a controlled substance.

While Manuel was in jail, the Illinois police laboratory tested the seized pills and reported that they contained no controlled substances.
Relying exclusively on that complaint, a county court judge found probable cause to detain Manuel pending trial.

But Manuel remained in custody, spending a total of 48 days in pretrial detention.
While Manuel was in jail, the Illinois police laboratory tested the seized pills and reported that they contained no controlled substances.

More than two years after his arrest, but less than two years after his criminal case was dismissed, Manuel filed a 42 U. S. C. ยง1983 lawsuit against Joliet and several of its police officers (collectively, the City), alleging that his arrest and detention violated the Fourth Amendment.
But Manuel remained in custody, spending a total of 48 days in pretrial detention.

The District Court dismissed Manuel's suit, holding, first, that the applicable two-year statute of limitations barred his unlawful arrest claim, and, second, that under binding Circuit precedent, pretrial detention following the start of legal process (here, the judge's probable-cause determination) could not give rise to a Fourth Amendment claim.
More than two years after his arrest, but less than two years after his criminal case was dismissed, Manuel filed a 42 U. S. C. ยง1983 lawsuit against Joliet and several of its police officers (collectively, the City), alleging that his arrest and detention violated the Fourth Amendment.

Manuel may challenge his pretrial detention on Fourth Amendment grounds.
Manuel appealed the dismissal of his unlawful detention claim; the Seventh Circuit affirmed.

In Gerstein v. Pugh, 420 U. S. 103, the Court decided that a pretrial detention challenge was governed by the Fourth Amendment, noting that the Fourth Amendment establishes the minimum constitutional "standards and procedures" not just for arrest but also for "detention," id., at 111, and "always has been thought to define" the appropriate process "for seizures of person[s] . . . in criminal cases, including the detention of suspects pending trial," id., at 125, n. 27.
This conclusion follows from the Court's settled precedent.

And in Albright v. Oliver, 510 U. S. 266, a majority of the Court again looked to the Fourth Amendment to assess pretrial restraints on liberty.

Relying on Gerstein, the plurality reiterated that the Fourth Amendment is the "relevan[t]" constitutional provision to assess the "deprivations of liberty that go hand in hand with criminal prosecutions."
And in Albright v. Oliver, 510 U. S. 266, a majority of the Court again looked to the Fourth Amendment to assess pretrial restraints on liberty.

That the pretrial restraints in Albright arose pursuant to legal process made no difference, given that they were allegedly unsupported by probable cause.
Relying on Gerstein, the plurality reiterated that the Fourth Amendment is the "relevan[t]" constitutional provision to assess the "deprivations of liberty that go hand in hand with criminal prosecutions."

As reflected in those cases, pretrial detention can violate the Fourth Amendment not only when it precedes, but also when it follows, the start of legal process.
That the pretrial restraints in Albright arose pursuant to legal process made no difference, given that they were allegedly unsupported by probable cause.

The Fourth Amendment prohibits government officials from detaining a person absent probable cause.
As reflected in those cases, pretrial detention can violate the Fourth Amendment not only when it precedes, but also when it follows, the start of legal process.

And where legal process has gone forward, but has done nothing to satisfy the probable-cause requirement, it cannot extinguish a detainee's Fourth Amendment claim.
The Fourth Amendment prohibits government officials from detaining a person absent probable cause.

That was the case here: Because the judge's determination of probable cause was based solely on fabricated evidence, it did not expunge Manuel's Fourth Amendment claim.
And where legal process has gone forward, but has done nothing to satisfy the probable-cause requirement, it cannot extinguish a detainee's Fourth Amendment claim.

For that reason, Manuel stated a Fourth Amendment claim when he sought relief not merely for his arrest, but also for his pretrial detention.
That was the case here: Because the judge's determination of probable cause was based solely on fabricated evidence, it did not expunge Manuel's Fourth Amendment claim.

On remand, the Seventh Circuit should determine the claim's accrual date, unless it finds that the City has previously waived its timeliness argument.
For that reason, Manuel stated a Fourth Amendment claim when he sought relief not merely for his arrest, but also for his pretrial detention.

In doing so, the court should look to the common law of torts for guidance, Carey v. Piphus, 435 U. S. 247, 257-258, while also closely attending to the values and purposes of the constitutional right at issue.
On remand, the Seventh Circuit should determine the claim's accrual date, unless it finds that the City has previously waived its timeliness argument.

on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the seventh circuit

Petitioner Elijah Manuel was held in jail for some seven weeks after a judge relied on allegedly fabricated evidence to find probable cause that he had committed a crime.
Justice Kagan delivered the opinion of the Court.

The primary question in this case is whether Manuel may bring a claim based on the Fourth Amendment to contest the legality of his pretrial confinement.
Petitioner Elijah Manuel was held in jail for some seven weeks after a judge relied on allegedly fabricated evidence to find probable cause that he had committed a crime.

Accordingly, we hold today that Manuel may challenge his pretrial detention on the ground that it violated the Fourth Amendment (while we leave all other issues, including one about that claim's timeliness, to the court below).
And those constitutional protections apply even after the start of "legal process" in a criminal case--here, that is, after the judge's determination of probable cause.

Shortly after midnight on March 18, 2011, Manuel was riding through Joliet, Illinois, in the passenger seat of a Dodge Charger, with his brother at the wheel.
Accordingly, we hold today that Manuel may challenge his pretrial detention on the ground that it violated the Fourth Amendment (while we leave all other issues, including one about that claim's timeliness, to the court below).

A pair of Joliet police officers pulled the car over when the driver failed to signal a turn.
Shortly after midnight on March 18, 2011, Manuel was riding through Joliet, Illinois, in the passenger seat of a Dodge Charger, with his brother at the wheel.

According to the complaint in this case, one of the officers dragged Manuel from the car, called him a racial slur, and kicked and punched him as he lay on the ground.
A pair of Joliet police officers pulled the car over when the driver failed to signal a turn.

Suspecting that the pills were actually illegal drugs, the officers conducted a field test of the bottle's contents.
According to the complaint in this case, one of the officers dragged Manuel from the car, called him a racial slur, and kicked and punched him as he lay on the ground.

The test came back negative for any controlled substance, leaving the officers with no evidence that Manuel had committed a crime.
Suspecting that the pills were actually illegal drugs, the officers conducted a field test of the bottle's contents.

Still, the officers arrested Manuel and took him to the Joliet police station.
The test came back negative for any controlled substance, leaving the officers with no evidence that Manuel had committed a crime.

There, an evidence technician tested the pills once again, and got the same (negative) result.
Still, the officers arrested Manuel and took him to the Joliet police station.

But the technician lied in his report, claiming that one of the pills was "found to be . . . positive for the probable presence of ecstasy."
There, an evidence technician tested the pills once again, and got the same (negative) result.

Similarly, one of the arresting officers wrote in his report that "[f ]rom [ his] training and experience, [ he] knew the pills to be ecstasy."
But the technician lied in his report, claiming that one of the pills was "found to be . . . positive for the probable presence of ecstasy."

On the basis of those statements, another officer swore out a criminal complaint against Manuel, charging him with unlawful possession of a controlled substance.
Similarly, one of the arresting officers wrote in his report that "[f ]rom [ his] training and experience, [ he] knew the pills to be ecstasy."

Manuel was brought before a county court judge later that day for a determination of whether there was probable cause for the charge, as necessary for further detention.
On the basis of those statements, another officer swore out a criminal complaint against Manuel, charging him with unlawful possession of a controlled substance.

The judge relied exclusively on the criminal complaint--which in turn relied exclusively on the police department's fabrications--to support a finding of probable cause.
Manuel was brought before a county court judge later that day for a determination of whether there was probable cause for the charge, as necessary for further detention.

Based on that determination, he sent Manuel to the county jail to await trial.
The judge relied exclusively on the criminal complaint--which in turn relied exclusively on the police department's fabrications--to support a finding of probable cause.

In the somewhat obscure legal lingo of this case, Manuel's subsequent detention was thus pursuant to "legal process"--because it followed from, and was authorized by, the judge's probable-cause determination.2
Based on that determination, he sent Manuel to the county jail to await trial.

While Manuel sat in jail, the Illinois police laboratory reexamined the seized pills, and on April 1, it issued a report concluding (just as the prior two tests had) that they contained no controlled substances.

The County Court immediately granted the request, and Manuel was released the next day.
Only on May 4 did an Assistant State's Attorney seek dismissal of the drug charge.

On April 22, 2013, Manuel brought this lawsuit under 42 U. S. C. ยง1983 against the City of Joliet and several of its police officers (collectively, the City).
The County Court immediately granted the request, and Manuel was released the next day.

Section 1983 creates a "species of tort liability," Imbler v. Pachtman, 424 U. S. 409, 417 (1976), for "the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution," ยง1983.
On April 22, 2013, Manuel brought this lawsuit under 42 U. S. C. ยง1983 against the City of Joliet and several of its police officers (collectively, the City).

Manuel's complaint alleged that the City violated his Fourth Amendment rights in two ways--first by arresting him at the roadside without any reason, and next by "detaining him in police custody" for almost seven weeks based entirely on made-up evidence.

The District Court dismissed Manuel's suit.
Manuel's complaint alleged that the City violated his Fourth Amendment rights in two ways--first by arresting him at the roadside without any reason, and next by "detaining him in police custody" for almost seven weeks based entirely on made-up evidence.

The court first held that the applicable two-year statute of limitations barred Manuel's claim for unlawful arrest, because more than two years had elapsed between the date of his arrest (March 18, 2011) and the filing of his complaint (April 22, 2013).
The District Court dismissed Manuel's suit.

But the court relied on another basis in rejecting Manuel's challenge to his subsequent detention (which stretched from March 18 to May 5, 2011).

Binding Circuit precedent, the District Court explained, made clear that pretrial detention following the start of legal process could not give rise to a Fourth Amendment claim.
But the court relied on another basis in rejecting Manuel's challenge to his subsequent detention (which stretched from March 18 to May 5, 2011).

According to that line of decisions, a ยง1983 plaintiff challenging such detention must allege a breach of the Due Process Clause--and must show, to recover on that theory, that state law fails to provide an adequate remedy.
Binding Circuit precedent, the District Court explained, made clear that pretrial detention following the start of legal process could not give rise to a Fourth Amendment claim.

Because Manuel's complaint rested solely on the Fourth Amendment--and because, in any event, Illinois's remedies were robust enough to preclude the due process avenue--the District Court found that Manuel had no way to proceed.
According to that line of decisions, a ยง1983 plaintiff challenging such detention must allege a breach of the Due Process Clause--and must show, to recover on that theory, that state law fails to provide an adequate remedy.

The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed the dismissal of Manuel's claim for unlawful detention (the only part of the District Court's decision Manuel appealed).

The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed the dismissal of Manuel's claim for unlawful detention (the only part of the District Court's decision Manuel appealed).

Once a person is detained pursuant to legal process, the court stated, "the Fourth Amendment falls out of the picture and the detainee's claim that the detention is improper becomes [one of] due process."
Invoking its prior caselaw, the Court of Appeals reiterated that such claims could not be brought under the Fourth Amendment.

And again: "When, after the arrest[,] a person is not let go when he should be, the Fourth Amendment gives way to the due process clause as a basis for challenging his detention."
Once a person is detained pursuant to legal process, the court stated, "the Fourth Amendment falls out of the picture and the detainee's claim that the detention is improper becomes [one of] due process."

So the Seventh Circuit held that Manuel's complaint, in alleging only a Fourth Amendment violation, rested on the wrong part of the Constitution: A person detained following the onset of legal process could at most (although, the court agreed, not in Illinois) challenge his pretrial confinement via the Due Process Clause.
And again: "When, after the arrest[,] a person is not let go when he should be, the Fourth Amendment gives way to the due process clause as a basis for challenging his detention."

The Seventh Circuit recognized that its position makes it an outlier among the Courts of Appeals, with ten others taking the opposite view.

The Fourth Amendment protects "[t]he right of the people to be secure in their persons . . . against unreasonable . . . seizures."
The Seventh Circuit recognized that its position makes it an outlier among the Courts of Appeals, with ten others taking the opposite view.

Manuel's complaint seeks just that protection.
The Fourth Amendment protects "[t]he right of the people to be secure in their persons . . . against unreasonable . . . seizures."

And that detention was "unreason-able," the complaint continues, because it was based solely on false evidence, rather than supported by probable cause.
Manuel's complaint seeks just that protection.

By their respective terms, then, Manuel's claim fits the Fourth Amendment, and the Fourth Amendment fits Manuel's claim, as hand in glove.

In Gerstein, two persons arrested without a warrant brought a ยง1983 suit complaining that they had been held in custody for "a substantial period solely on the decision of a prosecutor."
This Court decided some four decades ago that a claim challenging pretrial detention fell within the scope of the Fourth Amendment.

The Court looked to the Fourth Amendment to analyze--and uphold--their claim that such a pretrial restraint on liberty is unlawful unless a judge (or grand jury) first makes a reliable finding of probable cause.
In Gerstein, two persons arrested without a warrant brought a ยง1983 suit complaining that they had been held in custody for "a substantial period solely on the decision of a prosecutor."

The Fourth Amendment, we began, establishes the minimum constitutional "standards and procedures" not just for arrest but also for ensuing "detention."
The Court looked to the Fourth Amendment to analyze--and uphold--their claim that such a pretrial restraint on liberty is unlawful unless a judge (or grand jury) first makes a reliable finding of probable cause.

In choosing that Amendment "as the rationale for decision," the Court responded to a concurring Justice's view that the Due Process Clause offered the better framework: The Fourth Amendment, the majority countered, was "tailored explicitly for the criminal justice system, and it[ ] always has been thought to define" the appropriate process "for seizures of person[s] . . . in criminal cases, including the detention of suspects pending trial."
The Fourth Amendment, we began, establishes the minimum constitutional "standards and procedures" not just for arrest but also for ensuing "detention."

That Amendment, standing alone, guaranteed "a fair and reliable determination of probable cause as a condition for any significant pretrial restraint."

Accordingly, those detained prior to trial without such a finding could appeal to "the Fourth Amendment's protection against unfounded invasions of liberty."
That Amendment, standing alone, guaranteed "a fair and reliable determination of probable cause as a condition for any significant pretrial restraint."

And so too, a later decision indicates, those objecting to a pretrial deprivation of liberty may invoke the Fourth Amendment when (as here) that deprivation occurs after legal process commences.

The ยง1983 plaintiff in Albright complained of various pretrial restraints imposed after a court found probable cause to issue an arrest warrant, and then bind him over for trial, based on a policeman's unfounded charges.
And so too, a later decision indicates, those objecting to a pretrial deprivation of liberty may invoke the Fourth Amendment when (as here) that deprivation occurs after legal process commences.

For uncertain reasons, Albright ignored the Fourth Amendment in drafting his complaint; instead, he alleged that the defendant officer had infringed his substantive due process rights.
The ยง1983 plaintiff in Albright complained of various pretrial restraints imposed after a court found probable cause to issue an arrest warrant, and then bind him over for trial, based on a policeman's unfounded charges.

This Court rejected that claim, with five Justices in two opinions remitting Albright to the Fourth Amendment.

"The Framers," the plurality wrote, "considered the matter of pretrial deprivations of liberty and drafted the Fourth Amendment to address it."
This Court rejected that claim, with five Justices in two opinions remitting Albright to the Fourth Amendment.

That the deprivations at issue were pursuant to legal process made no difference, given that they were (allegedly) unsupported by probable cause; indeed, neither of the two opinions so much as mentioned that procedural circumstance.
"The Framers," the plurality wrote, "considered the matter of pretrial deprivations of liberty and drafted the Fourth Amendment to address it."

Relying on Gerstein, the plurality stated that the Fourth Amendment remained the "relevan[t]" constitutional provision to assess the "deprivations of liberty"--most notably, pretrial detention--"that go hand in hand with criminal prosecutions."

As reflected in Albright's tracking of Gerstein's analysis, pretrial detention can violate the Fourth Amendment not only when it precedes, but also when it follows, the start of legal process in a criminal case.

The Fourth Amendment prohibits government officials from detaining a person in the absence of probable cause.
As reflected in Albright's tracking of Gerstein's analysis, pretrial detention can violate the Fourth Amendment not only when it precedes, but also when it follows, the start of legal process in a criminal case.

That can happen when the police hold someone without any reason before the formal onset of a criminal proceeding.
The Fourth Amendment prohibits government officials from detaining a person in the absence of probable cause.

But it also can occur when legal process itself goes wrong--when, for example, a judge's probable-cause determination is predicated solely on a police officer's false statements.
That can happen when the police hold someone without any reason before the formal onset of a criminal proceeding.

Then, too, a person is confined without constitutionally adequate justification.
But it also can occur when legal process itself goes wrong--when, for example, a judge's probable-cause determination is predicated solely on a police officer's false statements.

And for that reason, it cannot extinguish the detainee's Fourth Amendment claim--or somehow, as the Seventh Circuit has held, convert that claim into one founded on the Due Process Clause.
Legal process has gone forward, but it has done nothing to satisfy the Fourth Amendment's probable-cause requirement.

If the complaint is that a form of legal process resulted in pretrial detention unsupported by probable cause, then the right allegedly infringed lies in the Fourth Amendment.6
And for that reason, it cannot extinguish the detainee's Fourth Amendment claim--or somehow, as the Seventh Circuit has held, convert that claim into one founded on the Due Process Clause.

For that reason, and contrary to the Seventh Circuit's view, Manuel stated a Fourth Amendment claim when he sought relief not merely for his (pre-legal-process) arrest, but also for his (post-legal-process) pretrial detention.7 Consider again the facts alleged in this case.
If the complaint is that a form of legal process resulted in pretrial detention unsupported by probable cause, then the right allegedly infringed lies in the Fourth Amendment.6

Police officers initially arrested Manuel without probable cause, based solely on his possession of pills that had field tested negative for an illegal substance.

So (putting timeliness issues aside) Manuel could bring a claim for wrongful arrest under the Fourth Amendment.
Police officers initially arrested Manuel without probable cause, based solely on his possession of pills that had field tested negative for an illegal substance.

And the same is true (again, disregarding timeliness) as to a claim for wrongful detention--because Manuel's subsequent weeks in custody were also unsupported by probable cause, and so also constitutionally unreasonable.
So (putting timeliness issues aside) Manuel could bring a claim for wrongful arrest under the Fourth Amendment.

No evidence of Manuel's criminality had come to light in between the roadside arrest and the County Court proceeding initiating legal process; to the contrary, yet another test of Man-uel's pills had come back negative in that period.
And the same is true (again, disregarding timeliness) as to a claim for wrongful detention--because Manuel's subsequent weeks in custody were also unsupported by probable cause, and so also constitutionally unreasonable.

And that means Manuel's ensuing pretrial detention, no less than his original arrest, violated his Fourth Amendment rights.

Our holding--that the Fourth Amendment governs a claim for unlawful pretrial detention even beyond the start of legal process--does not exhaust the disputed legal issues in this case.

In defining the contours and prerequisites of a ยง1983 claim, including its rule of accrual, courts are to look first to the common law of torts.
But with the following brief comments, we remand that issue to the court below.

In applying, selecting among, or adjusting common-law approaches, courts must closely attend to the values and purposes of the constitutional right at issue.

With these precepts as backdrop, Manuel and the City offer competing views about what accrual rule should govern a ยง1983 suit challenging post-legal-process pretrial detention.

According to Manuel, that Fourth Amendment claim accrues only upon the dismissal of criminal charges--here, on May 4, 2011, less than two years before he brought his suit.

An element of that tort is the "termination of the . . . proceeding in favor of the accused"; and accordingly, the statute of limitations does not start to run until that termination takes place.
Relying on this Court's caselaw, Manuel analogizes his claim to the common-law tort of malicious prosecution.

Man-uel argues that following the same rule in suits like his will avoid "conflicting resolutions" in ยง1983 litigation and criminal proceedings by "preclud[ing] the possibility of the claimant succeeding in the tort action after having been convicted in the underlying criminal prosecution."
An element of that tort is the "termination of the . . . proceeding in favor of the accused"; and accordingly, the statute of limitations does not start to run until that termination takes place.

In support of Manuel's position, all but two of the ten Courts of Appeals that have recognized a Fourth Amendment claim like his have incorporated a "favorable termination" element and so pegged the statute of limitations to the dismissal of the criminal case.

I join Justice Alito's opinion in full but write separately regarding the accrual date for a Fourth Amendment unreasonable-seizure claim.
on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the seventh circuit

Justice Alito suggests that a claim for unreasonable seizure based on a warrantless arrest might not accrue until the "first appearance" under Illinois law (or the "initial appearance" under federal law)--which ordinarily represents the first judicial determination of probable cause for that kind of arrest--rather than at the time of the arrest.
I join Justice Alito's opinion in full but write separately regarding the accrual date for a Fourth Amendment unreasonable-seizure claim.

Which of those events is the correct one for purposes of accrual makes no difference in this case, because both the arrest and the first appearance occurred more than two years before petitioner filed suit.

on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the seventh circuit

I agree with the Court's holding up to a point: The protection provided by the Fourth Amendment continues to apply after "the start of legal process," ante, at 1, if legal process is understood to mean the issuance of an arrest warrant or what is called a "first appearance" under Illinois law and an "initial appearance" under federal law.
Justice Alito, with whom Justice Thomas joins, dissenting.

But if the Court means more--specifically, that new Fourth Amendment claims continue to accrue as long as pretrial detention lasts--the Court stretches the concept of a seizure much too far.

What is perhaps most remarkable about the Court's approach is that it entirely ignores the question that we agreed to decide, i.e., whether a claim of malicious prosecution may be brought under the Fourth Amendment.

I would decide that question and hold that the Fourth Amendment cannot house any such claim.
What is perhaps most remarkable about the Court's approach is that it entirely ignores the question that we agreed to decide, i.e., whether a claim of malicious prosecution may be brought under the Fourth Amendment.

If a malicious prosecution claim may be brought under the Constitution, it must find some other home, presumably the Due Process Clause.
I would decide that question and hold that the Fourth Amendment cannot house any such claim.

The question that was set out in Manuel's petition for a writ of certiorari and that we agreed to decide is as follows:
If a malicious prosecution claim may be brought under the Constitution, it must find some other home, presumably the Due Process Clause.

"[W]hether an individual's Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable seizure continues beyond legal process so as to allow a malicious prosecution claim based upon the Fourth Amendment.
The question that was set out in Manuel's petition for a writ of certiorari and that we agreed to decide is as follows:

This question was raised, but left unanswered, by this Court in Albright v. Oliver, 510 U. S. 266 (1994).
"[W]hether an individual's Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable seizure continues beyond legal process so as to allow a malicious prosecution claim based upon the Fourth Amendment.

Since then, the First, Second, Third, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, Ninth, Tenth, Eleventh, and D. C. Circuits have all held that a Fourth Amendment malicious prosecution claim is cognizable through 42 U. S. C. ยง1983 ("Section 1983").

First, the conflict on the malicious prosecution question was the centerpiece of Manuel's argument in favor of certiorari.1 Second, unless Manuel is given the benefit of the unique accrual rule for malicious prosecution claims, his claim is untimely, and he is not entitled to relief.

The statute of limitations for Manuel's claim is Illinois's general statute of limitations for personal-injury torts, see Wallace v. Kato, 549 U. S. 384, 387 (2007), which requires suit to be brought within two years of the accrual of the claim, see Ill.
Manuel asked us to decide that question because it may be critical to his ultimate success in this lawsuit.

Here is the chronology of relevant events in this case:
The statute of limitations for Manuel's claim is Illinois's general statute of limitations for personal-injury torts, see Wallace v. Kato, 549 U. S. 384, 387 (2007), which requires suit to be brought within two years of the accrual of the claim, see Ill.

March 18, 2011: Manuel is arrested and brought before a county court judge, who makes the required probable-cause finding because Manuel was arrested without a warrant.
Here is the chronology of relevant events in this case:

March 31, 2011: Manuel is indicted by a grand jury.
March 18, 2011: Manuel is arrested and brought before a county court judge, who makes the required probable-cause finding because Manuel was arrested without a warrant.

May 4, 2011: An assistant state's attorney moves to dismiss the charges, and the motion is granted.
March 31, 2011: Manuel is indicted by a grand jury.

May 5, 2011: Manuel is released from jail.
May 4, 2011: An assistant state's attorney moves to dismiss the charges, and the motion is granted.

Since the statute of limitations requires the commencement of suit within two years of accrual, Manuel's claim is untimely unless it accrued on or after April 22, 2011.
May 5, 2011: Manuel is released from jail.

And the only events in the above chronology that occurred within that time frame are the dismissal of the charge against him and his release from custody.
Since the statute of limitations requires the commencement of suit within two years of accrual, Manuel's claim is untimely unless it accrued on or after April 22, 2011.

A claim of malicious prosecution "does not accrue until the criminal proceedings have terminated in the plaintiff's favor."
And the only events in the above chronology that occurred within that time frame are the dismissal of the charge against him and his release from custody.

None of the other common-law torts to which Manuel's claim might be compared--such as false arrest or false imprisonment--has such an accrual date.
A claim of malicious prosecution "does not accrue until the criminal proceedings have terminated in the plaintiff's favor."

Therefore, if Manuel's case is to go forward, it is essential that his claim be treated like a malicious prosecution claim.
None of the other common-law torts to which Manuel's claim might be compared--such as false arrest or false imprisonment--has such an accrual date.

Although the Court refuses to decide whether Manuel's claim should be so treated, the answer to that question--the one that the Court actually agreed to review--is straightforward: A malicious prosecution claim cannot be based on the Fourth Amendment.
Therefore, if Manuel's case is to go forward, it is essential that his claim be treated like a malicious prosecution claim.

"The first inquiry in any ยง1983 suit," the Court has explained, is "to isolate the precise constitutional violation with which [the defendant] is charged."
Although the Court refuses to decide whether Manuel's claim should be so treated, the answer to that question--the one that the Court actually agreed to review--is straightforward: A malicious prosecution claim cannot be based on the Fourth Amendment.

In this case, Manuel charges that he was seized without probable cause in violation of the Fourth Amendment.
"The first inquiry in any ยง1983 suit," the Court has explained, is "to isolate the precise constitutional violation with which [the defendant] is charged."

In order to flesh out the elements of this constitutional tort, we must look for "tort analogies."
In this case, Manuel charges that he was seized without probable cause in violation of the Fourth Amendment.

Manuel says that the appropriate analog is the tort of malicious prosecution, so we should look to the elements of that tort.
In order to flesh out the elements of this constitutional tort, we must look for "tort analogies."

There is a severe mismatch between these elements and the Fourth Amendment.
Manuel says that the appropriate analog is the tort of malicious prosecution, so we should look to the elements of that tort.

First, the defendants typically named in Fourth Amendment seizure cases--namely, law enforcement officers--lack the authority to initiate or dismiss a prosecution.
There is a severe mismatch between these elements and the Fourth Amendment.

That authority lies in the hands of prosecutors.
First, the defendants typically named in Fourth Amendment seizure cases--namely, law enforcement officers--lack the authority to initiate or dismiss a prosecution.

But when that occurs, the officer is simply a witness and is not responsible for "the decision to press criminal charges."
A law enforcement officer, including the officer responsible for the defendant's arrest, may testify before a grand jury, at a preliminary examination, see Ill.

Second, while subjective bad faith, i.e., malice, is the core element of a malicious prosecution claim, it is firmly established that the Fourth Amendment standard of reasonableness is fundamentally objective.
But when that occurs, the officer is simply a witness and is not responsible for "the decision to press criminal charges."

These two standards--one subjective and the other objective--cannot co-exist.
Second, while subjective bad faith, i.e., malice, is the core element of a malicious prosecution claim, it is firmly established that the Fourth Amendment standard of reasonableness is fundamentally objective.

An officer could act unreasonably, thereby violating the Fourth Amendment, without even a hint of bad faith.
In some instances, importing a malice requirement into the Fourth Amendment would leave culpable conduct unpunished.

An officer could harbor intense personal ill will toward an arrestee but still act in an objectively reasonable manner in carrying out an arrest.
In other cases, the malice requirement would cast too wide a net.

The Fourth Amendment, after all, prohibits all unreasonable seizures--regardless of whether a prosecution is ever brought or how a prosecution ends.
Finally, malicious prosecution's favorable-termination element makes no sense when the claim is that a seizure violated the Fourth Amendment.

A "Fourth Amendment wrong" "is fully accomplished," United States v. Calandra, 414 U. S. 338, 354 (1974), when an impermissible seizure occurs.
The Fourth Amendment, after all, prohibits all unreasonable seizures--regardless of whether a prosecution is ever brought or how a prosecution ends.

The Amendment is violated and the injury is inflicted no matter what happens in any later proceedings.
A "Fourth Amendment wrong" "is fully accomplished," United States v. Calandra, 414 U. S. 338, 354 (1974), when an impermissible seizure occurs.

Our cases concerning Fourth Amendment claims brought under 42 U. S. C. ยง1983 prove the point.
The Amendment is violated and the injury is inflicted no matter what happens in any later proceedings.

For example, we have recognized that there is no favorable-termination element for a Fourth Amendment false imprisonment claim.
Our cases concerning Fourth Amendment claims brought under 42 U. S. C. ยง1983 prove the point.

By the same token, an individual may seek damages for pretrial Fourth Amendment violations even after a valid conviction.
For example, we have recognized that there is no favorable-termination element for a Fourth Amendment false imprisonment claim.

For example, in Haring v. Prosise, 462 U. S. 306, 308 (1983), the respondent pleaded guilty to a drug crime without raising any Fourth Amendment issues.
By the same token, an individual may seek damages for pretrial Fourth Amendment violations even after a valid conviction.

He then brought a ยง1983 suit, challenging the constitutionality of the search that led to the discovery of the drugs on which his criminal charge was based.
For example, in Haring v. Prosise, 462 U. S. 306, 308 (1983), the respondent pleaded guilty to a drug crime without raising any Fourth Amendment issues.

The Court held that respondent's suit could proceed--despite his valid conviction.
He then brought a ยง1983 suit, challenging the constitutionality of the search that led to the discovery of the drugs on which his criminal charge was based.

The favorable-termination element is similarly irrelevant to claims like Manuel's.
The Court held that respondent's suit could proceed--despite his valid conviction.

Manuel alleges that he was arrested and held based entirely on falsified evidence.
The favorable-termination element is similarly irrelevant to claims like Manuel's.

In such a case, it makes no difference whether the prosecution was eventually able to gather and introduce legitimate evidence and to obtain a conviction at trial.
Manuel alleges that he was arrested and held based entirely on falsified evidence.

For all these reasons, malicious prosecution is a strikingly inapt "tort analog[y]," Wilson, 471 U. S., at 277, for Fourth Amendment violations.
Accordingly, there is no good reason why the accrual of a claim like Manuel's should have to await a favorable termination of the prosecution.

So the answer to the question presented in Manuel's certiorari petition is that the Fourth Amendment does not give rise to a malicious prosecution claim, and this means that Manuel's suit is untimely.
For all these reasons, malicious prosecution is a strikingly inapt "tort analog[y]," Wilson, 471 U. S., at 277, for Fourth Amendment violations.

I would affirm the Seventh Circuit on that basis.
So the answer to the question presented in Manuel's certiorari petition is that the Fourth Amendment does not give rise to a malicious prosecution claim, and this means that Manuel's suit is untimely.

Instead of deciding the question on which we granted review, the Court ventures in a different direction.
I would affirm the Seventh Circuit on that basis.

The Court purports to refrain from deciding any issue of timeliness, see ante, at 10, but the Court's opinion is certain to be read by some to mean that every moment of pretrial confinement without probable cause constitutes a violation of the Fourth Amendment.
Instead of deciding the question on which we granted review, the Court ventures in a different direction.

And if that is so, it would seem to follow that new Fourth Amendment claims continue to accrue as long as the pretrial detention lasts.
The Court purports to refrain from deciding any issue of timeliness, see ante, at 10, but the Court's opinion is certain to be read by some to mean that every moment of pretrial confinement without probable cause constitutes a violation of the Fourth Amendment.

That proposition--that every moment in pretrial detention constitutes a "seizure"--is hard to square with the ordinary meaning of the term.
And if that is so, it would seem to follow that new Fourth Amendment claims continue to accrue as long as the pretrial detention lasts.

The term "seizure" applies most directly to the act of taking a person into custody or otherwise depriving the person of liberty.
That proposition--that every moment in pretrial detention constitutes a "seizure"--is hard to square with the ordinary meaning of the term.

As the Court has explained before, "[f]rom the time of the founding to the present, the word 'seizure' has meant a 'taking possession.' "
Dictionary definitions from around the time of the adoption of the Fourth Amendment define the term "seizure" as a single event--and not a continuing condition.

And we have cautioned against "stretch[ing] the Fourth Amendment beyond its words and beyond the meaning of arrest."
As the Court has explained before, "[f]rom the time of the founding to the present, the word 'seizure' has meant a 'taking possession.' "

The Members of Congress who proposed the Fourth Amendment and the State legislatures that ratified the Amendment would have expected to see a more expansive term, such as "detention" or "confinement," if a Fourth Amendment seizure could be a long event that continued throughout the entirety of the pretrial period.
And we have cautioned against "stretch[ing] the Fourth Amendment beyond its words and beyond the meaning of arrest."

In my view, a period of detention spanning weeks or months cannot be viewed as one long, continuing seizure, and a pretrial detainee is not "seized" over and over again as long as he remains in custody.3 Of course, the damages resulting from an unlawful seizure may continue to mount during the period of confinement caused by the seizure, but no new Fourth Amendment seizure claims accrue after that date.4 Thus, any possible Fourth Amendment claim that Manuel could bring is time barred.
The Members of Congress who proposed the Fourth Amendment and the State legislatures that ratified the Amendment would have expected to see a more expansive term, such as "detention" or "confinement," if a Fourth Amendment seizure could be a long event that continued throughout the entirety of the pretrial period.

The Court reads Albright v. Oliver, 510 U. S. 266 (1994), and Gerstein v. Pugh, 420 U. S. 103 (1975), to mean that the Fourth Amendment can be violated "when legal process itself goes wrong," ante, at 9, but the accuracy of that interpretation depends on the meaning of "legal process."

The Court's reading is correct if by "legal process" the Court means a determination of probable cause at a first or initial appearance.

When an arrest warrant is obtained, the probable-cause determination is made at that time, and there is thus no need for a repeat determination at the first or initial appearance.
The Court's reading is correct if by "legal process" the Court means a determination of probable cause at a first or initial appearance.

But when an arrest is made without a warrant, the arrestee, generally within 48 hours, must be brought before a judicial officer, County of Riverside v. McLaughlin, 500 U. S. 44, 56 (1991), who then completes the arrest process by making the same determination that would have been made as part of the warrant application process.
When an arrest warrant is obtained, the probable-cause determination is made at that time, and there is thus no need for a repeat determination at the first or initial appearance.

Thus, this appearance is an integral part of the process of taking the arrestee into custody and easily falls within the meaning of the term "seizure."

But other forms of "legal process," for example, a grand jury indictment or a determination of probable cause at a preliminary examination or hearing, do not fit within the concept of a "seizure," and the cases cited by the Court do not suggest otherwise.

A detective named Oliver procured a warrant for the arrest of Albright for distributing a "look-alike" substance.
But other forms of "legal process," for example, a grand jury indictment or a determination of probable cause at a preliminary examination or hearing, do not fit within the concept of a "seizure," and the cases cited by the Court do not suggest otherwise.

The warrant was based on information given to Oliver by the purchaser of the substance.
A detective named Oliver procured a warrant for the arrest of Albright for distributing a "look-alike" substance.

After learning of the warrant, Albright turned himself in, was booked, and was released on bond.
The warrant was based on information given to Oliver by the purchaser of the substance.

Oliver testified at what Illinois calls a preliminary examination and apparently related the information provided by the alleged purchaser.
After learning of the warrant, Albright turned himself in, was booked, and was released on bond.

According to the Seventh Circuit, probable cause was sorely lacking, id., at 345, and Albright sued Oliver under 42 U. S. C. ยง1983, claiming that Oliver had violated his substantive due process right not to be prosecuted without probable cause.
The judge found probable cause, but the charges were later dismissed.

All that this Court held was that Albright's claim had to be analyzed under the Fourth Amendment, not substantive due process.
According to the Seventh Circuit, probable cause was sorely lacking, id., at 345, and Albright sued Oliver under 42 U. S. C. ยง1983, claiming that Oliver had violated his substantive due process right not to be prosecuted without probable cause.

The Court now reads Albright to mean that a Fourth Amendment seizure continues "after the start of 'legal process," but three forms of what might be termed "legal process" were issued in Albright: the arrest warrant, the order releasing him on bond after his first appearance, and the order holding him over for trial after the preliminary examination.
All that this Court held was that Albright's claim had to be analyzed under the Fourth Amendment, not substantive due process.

I agree that Albright's seizure did not end with the issuance of the warrant (that would be ridiculous since he had not even been arrested at that point) or the first appearance, see ante, at 8-9, and n. 6, but it is impossible to read anything more into the holding in Albright.

The terse plurality opinion joined by four Justices said no more; the opinion of Justice Scalia, who joined the plurality opinion, referred only to Albright's "arrest," 510 U. S., at 275 (concurring opinion); and Justices Kennedy and Thomas, who concurred in the judgment, did so only because Albright's "allegation of arrest without probable cause must be analyzed under the Fourth Amendment."

To read anything more into Albright is to adopt the position taken by just one Member of the plurality, see id., at 279 (Ginsburg, J., concurring) (seizure continues throughout the period of pretrial detention), and the two Justices in dissent, see id., at 307 (Stevens, J., dissenting) (same).

All that the Court held in Gerstein was that if there is no probable-cause finding by a neutral magistrate before an arrest, there must be one after the arrest.

The Court reasoned that "the Fourth Amendment requires a judicial determination of probable cause as a prerequisite to extended restraint of liberty following arrest."

The Court said nothing about whether a claim for a seizure in violation of the Fourth Amendment could accrue after an initial appearance.

The Court thus is forced to rely on dicta--taken out of context--from Gerstein.
The Court said nothing about whether a claim for a seizure in violation of the Fourth Amendment could accrue after an initial appearance.

For example, the Court cites Gerstein's statement that "[t]he Fourth Amendment was tailored explicitly for the criminal justice system," and that it "always has been thought to define the 'process that is due' for seizures of person[s] . . . in criminal cases, including the detention of suspects pending trial."
The Court thus is forced to rely on dicta--taken out of context--from Gerstein.

This statement hardly shows that a Fourth Amendment seizure continues throughout a period of pretrial detention, and the Court does not mention the very next sentence in Gerstein--which suggests that the Fourth Amendment might govern "only the first stage" of a prosecution, eventually giving way to other protections that are also part of our "elaborate system, unique in jurisprudence, designed to safeguard the rights of those accused of criminal conduct."

In the end, Gerstein stands for the proposition that the Fourth Amendment requires a post-arrest probable cause finding by a neutral magistrate; it says nothing about whether the Fourth Amendment extends beyond that or any other "legal process."

The Court's decision today violates that rule by avoiding the question presented in order to reach an unnecessary and tricky issue.
A well-known medical maxim--"first, do no harm"--is a good rule of thumb for courts as well.

And it has the potential to do much harm--by dramatically expanding Fourth Amendment liability under ยง1983 in a way that does violence to the text of the Fourth Amendment.
The resulting opinion will, I fear, inject much confusion into Fourth Amendment law.

Because we here review an order dismissing Manuel's suit, we accept as true all the factual allegations in his complaint.
And it has the potential to do much harm--by dramatically expanding Fourth Amendment liability under ยง1983 in a way that does violence to the text of the Fourth Amendment.

Although not addressed in Manuel's complaint, the police department's alleged fabrications did not stop at this initial hearing on probable cause.
Because we here review an order dismissing Manuel's suit, we accept as true all the factual allegations in his complaint.

About two weeks later, on March 30, a grand jury indicted Manuel based on similar false evidence: testimony from one of the arresting officers that "[t]he pills field tested positive" for ecstasy.
Although not addressed in Manuel's complaint, the police department's alleged fabrications did not stop at this initial hearing on probable cause.

Manuel's allegation of unlawful detention concerns only the period after the onset of legal process--here meaning, again, after the County Court found probable cause that he had committed a crime.
About two weeks later, on March 30, a grand jury indicted Manuel based on similar false evidence: testimony from one of the arresting officers that "[t]he pills field tested positive" for ecstasy.

But throughout this litigation, Manuel has treated that short period as part and parcel of the initial unlawful arrest.

In County of Riverside v. McLaughlin, 500 U. S. 44, 47 (1991), we considered how quickly a jurisdiction must provide the probable-cause determination that Gerstein demanded "as a prerequisite to an extended pretrial detention."
The Court repeated the same idea in a follow-on decision to Gerstein.

In arguing for still greater speed, the principal dissent invoked the original meaning of "the Fourth Amendment's prohibition of 'unreasonable seizures,' insofar as it applies to seizure of the person."
In holding that the decision should occur within 48 hours of an arrest, the majority understood its "task [as] articulat[ing] more clearly the boundaries of what is permissible under the Fourth Amendment."

The difference between the two opinions was significant, but the commonality still more so: All Justices agreed that the Fourth Amendment provides the appropriate lens through which to view a claim involving pretrial detention.
In arguing for still greater speed, the principal dissent invoked the original meaning of "the Fourth Amendment's prohibition of 'unreasonable seizures,' insofar as it applies to seizure of the person."

The opposite view would suggest an untenable result: that a person arrested pursuant to a warrant could not bring a Fourth Amendment claim challenging the reasonableness of even his arrest, let alone any subsequent detention.

On multiple occasions during oral argument in this Court, the City agreed that "a Fourth Amendment right . . . survive[d] the initiation of process" at the hearing in which the county judge found probable cause and ordered detention.
Even the City no longer appears to contest that conclusion.

The dissent goes some way toward claiming that a different kind of pretrial legal process--a grand jury indictment or preliminary examination--does expunge such a Fourth Amendment claim.

The effect of that view would be to cut off Manuel's claim on the date of his grand jury indictment (March 30)--even though that indictment (like the County Court's probable-cause proceeding) was entirely based on false testi-mony and even though Manuel remained in detention for 36 days longer.

Nothing in the nature of the legal proceeding establishing probable cause makes a difference for purposes of the Fourth Amendment: Whatever its precise form, if the proceeding is tainted--as here, by fabricated evidence--and the result is that probable cause is lacking, then the ensuing pretrial detention violates the confined person's Fourth Amendment rights, for all the reasons we have stated.
We can see no principled reason to draw that line.

By contrast (and contrary to the dissent's suggestion, see post, at 9, n. 3), once a trial has occurred, the Fourth Amendment drops out: A person challenging the sufficiency of the evidence to support both a conviction and any ensuing incarceration does so under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

In their words, the Framers "drafted the Fourth Amendment" to address "the matter of pretrial deprivations of liberty," Albright, 510 U. S., at 274 (emphasis added), and the Amendment thus provides "standards and procedures" for "the detention of suspects pending trial," Gerstein, 420 U. S., at 125, n. 27 (emphasis added).
Gerstein and Albright, as already suggested, both reflected and recognized that constitutional division of labor.

The two exceptions--the Ninth and D. C. Circuits--have not yet weighed in on whether a Fourth Amendment claim like Manuel's includes a "favorable termination" element.

The dissent would have us address these questions anyway, on the ground that "the conflict on the malicious prosecution question was the centerpiece of Manuel's argument in favor of certiorari."
The two exceptions--the Ninth and D. C. Circuits--have not yet weighed in on whether a Fourth Amendment claim like Manuel's includes a "favorable termination" element.

But the decision below did not implicate a "conflict on the malicious prosecution question"--because the Seventh Circuit, in holding that detainees like Manuel could not bring a Fourth Amendment claim at all, never considered whether (and, if so, how) that claim should resemble the malicious prosecution tort.

But the decision below did not implicate a "conflict on the malicious prosecution question"--because the Seventh Circuit, in holding that detainees like Manuel could not bring a Fourth Amendment claim at all, never considered whether (and, if so, how) that claim should resemble the malicious prosecution tort.

The principal part of his question presented--mirroring the one and only Circuit split involving the decision below--reads as follows: "[W]hether an individual's Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable seizure continues beyond legal process."
Nor did Manuel's petition for certiorari suggest otherwise.

But as to that secondary issue, we think (for all the reasons just stated) that Manuel jumped the gun.
The rest of Manuel's question did indeed express a view as to what would follow from an affirmative answer ("so as to allow a malicious prosecution claim").

And contra the dissent, his doing so provides no warrant for our doing so too.

As the Seventh Circuit acknowledged, its decision in this case and an earlier case on which the decision here relied, Newsome v. McCabe, 256 F. 3d 747 (2001), conflict with decisions of other circuits holding that a malicious prosecution claim may be brought under the Fourth Amendment.

By his count, 10 other Circuits have recognized federal malicious-prosecution claims under the Fourth Amendment."
The decision below states: "Manuel argues that we should reconsider our holding in Newsome and recognize a federal claim for malicious prosecution under the Fourth Amendment regardless of the available state remedy.

The court refused to overrule Newsome and said that "Manuel's argument is better left for the Supreme Court."

Manuel's petition for a writ of certiorari repeatedly made the same point.

("[E]ight circuits have held that malicious prosecution is cognizable through a Section 1983 Fourth Amendment claim").

All of the decisions that are cited as being in conflict with the decision below involved malicious prosecution claims and are described as such.

In Wallace, the Court noted that "[f]alse arrest and false imprisonment overlap" and decided to "refer to the two torts together as false imprisonment."

The Court writes that "[n]othing in the nature of the legal proceeding establishing probable cause makes a difference for purposes of the Fourth Amendment."
By the Court's logic, there is no apparent reason why even a judgment of conviction should cut off the accrual of new Fourth Amendment claims based on the use of fabricated evidence.

[I]f the proceeding is tainted--as here, by fabricated evidence--and the result is that probable cause is lacking," the Court continues, "then the ensuing pretrial detention violates the confined person's Fourth Amendment rights, for all the reasons we have stated."

If a detainee is transferred following conviction from the section for detainees to the section for prisoners, does the transfer render this person "unseized"?

There is authority for the proposition that a grand jury indictment or a determination of probable cause after an adversary proceeding may be an intervening cause that cuts off liability for an unlawful arrest.

Between 2004 and 2009, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) intermittently investigated petitioner Marinello's tax activities.
I would not decide that question here.

In 2012, the Government indicted Marinello for violating, among other criminal tax statutes, a provision in 26 U. S. C. ยง7212(a) known as the Omnibus Clause, which forbids "corruptly or by force or threats of force . . . obstruct[ing] or imped[ing], or endeavor[ing] to obstruct or impede, the due administration of [the Internal Revenue Code]."
Between 2004 and 2009, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) intermittently investigated petitioner Marinello's tax activities.

The judge instructed the jury that, to convict Marinello of an Omnibus Clause violation, it must find that he "corruptly" engaged in at least one of eight specified activities, but the jury was not told that it needed to find that Marinello knew he was under investigation and intended corruptly to interfere with that investigation.

Held: To convict a defendant under the Omnibus Clause, the Government must prove the defendant was aware of a pending tax-related proceeding, such as a particular investigation or audit, or could reasonably foresee that such a proceeding would commence.
The Second Circuit affirmed, rejecting his claim that an Omnibus Clause violation requires the Government to show the defendant tried to interfere with a pending IRS proceeding, such as a particular investigation.

In United States v. Aguilar, 515 U. S. 593, this Court interpreted a similarly worded criminal statute--which made it a felony "corruptly or by threats or force . . .

The Court said that the defendant's "act must have a relationship in time, causation, or logic with the judicial proceedings."
There, the Court required the Government to show there was a "nexus" between the defendant's obstructive conduct and a particular judicial proceeding.

In reaching this conclusion, the Court emphasized that it has "traditionally exercised restraint in assessing the reach of a federal criminal statute, both out of deference to the prerogatives of Congress and out of concern that 'a fair warning should be given to the world in language that the common world will understand, of what the law intends to do if a certain line is passed.' "
The Court said that the defendant's "act must have a relationship in time, causation, or logic with the judicial proceedings."

That reasoning applies here with similar strength.

The first part of the sentence also refers to "force or threats of force," which the statute elsewhere defines as "threats of bodily harm to the officer or employee of the United States or to a member of his family."
The Omnibus Clause appears in the middle of a sentence that refers to efforts to "intimidate or impede any officer or employee of the United States acting in an official capacity."

And ยง7212(b) refers to the "forcibl[e] rescu[e]" of "any property after it shall have been seized under" the Internal Revenue Code.

In context, the Omnibus Clause logically serves as a "catchall" for the obstructive conduct the subsection sets forth, not for every violation that interferes with routine administrative procedures such as the processing of tax returns, receipt of tax payments, or issuance of tax refunds.

Interpreting the Omnibus Clause to apply to all Code administration could transform the Code's numerous misdemeanor provisions into felonies, making them redundant or perhaps the subject matter of plea bargaining.
The broader context of the full Internal Revenue Code also counsels against a broad reading.

It could also result in a similar lack of fair warning and related kinds of unfairness that led this Court to "exercise" interpretive "restraint" in Aguilar.

It could also result in a similar lack of fair warning and related kinds of unfairness that led this Court to "exercise" interpretive "restraint" in Aguilar.

The term "particular administrative proceeding" does not mean every act carried out by IRS employees in the course of their administration of the Tax Code.
Following the same approach taken in similar cases, the Government here must show that there is a "nexus" between the defendant's conduct and a particular administrative proceeding, such as an investigation, an audit, or other targeted administrative action.

Just because a taxpayer knows that the IRS will review her tax return annually does not transform every Tax Code violation into an obstruction charge.
The term "particular administrative proceeding" does not mean every act carried out by IRS employees in the course of their administration of the Tax Code.

In addition to satisfying the nexus requirement, the Government must show that the proceeding was pending at the time the defendant engaged in the obstructive conduct or, at the least, was then reasonably foreseeable by the defendant.

Justice Breyer delivered the opinion of the Court.
on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the second circuit

A clause in ยง7212(a) of the Internal Revenue Code makes it a felony "corruptly or by force" to "endeavo[r] to obstruct or imped[e] the due administration of this title."
Justice Breyer delivered the opinion of the Court.

Does it cover virtually all governmental efforts to collect taxes?
The question here concerns the breadth of that statutory phrase.

Or does it have a narrower scope?
Does it cover virtually all governmental efforts to collect taxes?

In our view, "due administration of [the Tax Code]" does not cover routine administrative procedures that are near-universally applied to all taxpayers, such as the ordinary processing of income tax returns.
Or does it have a narrower scope?

Rather, the clause as a whole refers to specific interference with targeted governmental tax-related proceedings, such as a particular investigation or audit.

As we said at the outset, we here consider the scope of the Omnibus Clause.

Between 2004 and 2009, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) opened, then closed, then reopened an investigation into the tax activities of Carlo Marinello, the petitioner here.

In 2012 the Government indicted Marinello, charging him with violations of several criminal tax statutes including the Omnibus Clause.
Between 2004 and 2009, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) opened, then closed, then reopened an investigation into the tax activities of Carlo Marinello, the petitioner here.

In respect to the Omnibus Clause the Government claimed that Marinello had engaged in at least one of eight different specified activities, including "failing to maintain corporate books and records," "failing to provide" his tax accountant "with complete and accurate" tax "information," "destroying . . . business records," "hiding income," and "paying employees . . . with cash."
In 2012 the Government indicted Marinello, charging him with violations of several criminal tax statutes including the Omnibus Clause.

Before the jury retired to consider the charges, the judge instructed it that, to convict Marinello of violating the Omnibus Clause, it must find unanimously that he engaged in at least one of the eight practices just mentioned, that the jurors need not agree on which one, and that he did so "corruptly," meaning "with the intent to secure an unlawful advantage or benefit, either for [himself ] or for another."
In respect to the Omnibus Clause the Government claimed that Marinello had engaged in at least one of eight different specified activities, including "failing to maintain corporate books and records," "failing to provide" his tax accountant "with complete and accurate" tax "information," "destroying . . . business records," "hiding income," and "paying employees . . . with cash."

The judge, however, did not instruct the jury that it must find that Marinello knew he was under investigation and intended corruptly to interfere with that investigation.

He argued, among other things, that a violation of the Omnibus Clause requires the Government to show that the defendant had tried to interfere with a "pending IRS proceeding," such as a particular investigation.

The full Court of Appeals rejected Marinello's petition for rehearing, two judges dissenting.
It held that a defendant need not possess " 'an awareness of a particular [IRS] action or investigation.' "

Marinello then petitioned for certiorari, asking us to decide whether the Omnibus Clause requires the Government to prove the defendant was aware of "a pending IRS action or proceeding, such as an investigation or audit," when he "engaged in the purportedly obstructive conduct."

But the verbs "obstruct" and "impede" suggest an object--the taxpayer must hinder a particular person or thing.

That is because the Code creates numerous misdemeanors, ranging from willful failure to furnish a required statement to employees, ยง7204, to failure to keep required records, ยง7203, to misrepresenting the number of exemptions to which an employee is entitled on IRS Form W-4, ยง7205, to failure to pay any tax owed, however small the amount, ยง7203.

Indeed, as the dissent notes, post, at 8 (opinion of Thomas, J.), Marinello's preferred reading of ยง7212 potentially overlaps with another provision of federal law that criminalizes the obstruction of the "due and proper administration of the law under which any pending proceeding is being had before any department or agency of the United States," 18 U. S. C. ยง1505.
Some overlap in criminal provisions is, of course, inevitable.

But we have not found any case from this Court interpreting a statutory provision that would create overlap and redundancy to the degree that would result from the Government's broad reading of ยง7212--particularly when it would " 'render superfluous other provisions in the same enactment.' "

But we have not found any case from this Court interpreting a statutory provision that would create overlap and redundancy to the degree that would result from the Government's broad reading of ยง7212--particularly when it would " 'render superfluous other provisions in the same enactment.' "

Interpreted broadly, the provision could apply to a person who pays a babysitter $41 per week in cash without withholding taxes, see 26 CFR ยง31.3102-1(a)(2017); IRS, Publication 926, pp. 5-6 (2018), leaves a large cash tip in a restaurant, fails to keep donation receipts from every charity to which he or she contributes, or fails to provide every record to an accountant.
A broad interpretation would also risk the lack of fair warning and related kinds of unfairness that led this Court in Aguilar to "exercise" interpretive "restraint."

Such an individual may sometimes believe that, in doing so, he is running the risk of having violated an IRS rule, but we sincerely doubt he would believe he is facing a potential felony prosecution for tax obstruction.

Had Congress intended that outcome, it would have spoken with more clarity than it did in ยง7212(a).
Such an individual may sometimes believe that, in doing so, he is running the risk of having violated an IRS rule, but we sincerely doubt he would believe he is facing a potential felony prosecution for tax obstruction.

Yet, practically speaking, we struggle to imagine a scenario where a taxpayer would "willfully" violate the Tax Code (the mens rea requirement of various tax crimes, including misdemeanors, see, e.g., 26 U. S. C. ยงยง7203, 7204, 7207) without intending someone to obtain an unlawful advantage.
The Government asserts that "corruptly" means acting with "the specific intent to obtain an unlawful advantage" for the defendant or another.

For the same reason, we find unconvincing the dissent's argument that the distinction between "willfully" and "corruptly"--at least as defined by the Government--reflects any meaningful difference in culpability.

But it used the clause more often after the early 1990's.
True, the Government used the Omnibus Clause only sparingly during the first few decades after its enactment.

And, at oral argument the Government told us that, where more punitive and less punitive criminal provisions both apply to a defendant's conduct, the Government will charge a violation of the more punitive provision as long as it can readily prove that violation at trial.
But it used the clause more often after the early 1990's.

Regardless, to rely upon prosecutorial discretion to narrow the otherwise wide-ranging scope of a criminal statute's highly abstract general statutory language places great power in the hands of the prosecutor.

Doing so risks allowing "policemen, prosecutors, and juries to pursue their personal predilections," Smith v. Goguen, 415 U. S. 566, 575 (1974), which could result in the nonuniform execution of that power across time and geographic location.
Regardless, to rely upon prosecutorial discretion to narrow the otherwise wide-ranging scope of a criminal statute's highly abstract general statutory language places great power in the hands of the prosecutor.

The dissent points out, for example, that the predecessor to the obstruction statute we interpreted in Aguilar, 18 U. S.

We consequently find these precedents--though not controlling--highly instructive for use as a guide toward a proper resolution of the issue now before us.
The language of some and the underlying principles of all these cases are similar.

We conclude that, to secure a conviction under the Omnibus Clause, the Government must show (among other things) that there is a "nexus" between the defendant's conduct and a particular administrative proceeding, such as an investigation, an audit, or other targeted administrative action.

By "particular administrative proceeding" we do not mean every act carried out by IRS employees in the course of their "continuous, ubiquitous, and universally known" administration of the Tax Code.
That nexus requires a "relationship in time, causation, or logic with the [administrative] proceeding."

While we need not here exhaustively itemize the types of administrative conduct that fall within the scope of the statute, that conduct does not include routine, day-to-day work carried out in the ordinary course by the IRS, such as the review of tax returns.
By "particular administrative proceeding" we do not mean every act carried out by IRS employees in the course of their "continuous, ubiquitous, and universally known" administration of the Tax Code.

The Government contends the processing of tax returns is part of the administration of the Internal Revenue Code and any corrupt effort to interfere with that task can therefore serve as the basis of an obstruction conviction.

In light of our decision in Aguilar, we find it appropriate to construe ยง7212's Omnibus Clause more narrowly than the Government proposes.
But we nevertheless held the defendant's conduct did not support an obstruction charge.

It is not enough for the Government to claim that the defendant knew the IRS may catch on to his unlawful scheme eventually.
In addition to satisfying this nexus requirement, the Government must show that the proceeding was pending at the time the defendant engaged in the obstructive conduct or, at the least, was then reasonably foreseeable by the defendant.

To use a maritime analogy, the proceeding must at least be in the offing.
It is not enough for the Government to claim that the defendant knew the IRS may catch on to his unlawful scheme eventually.

I agree with the Court's interpretations of "obstruct or impede" and "due administration," which together refer to conduct that hinders the IRS' performance of its official duties.

I also agree that the object of these words--the thing a person is prohibited from obstructing the due administration of--is "this title," i.e., Title 26, which contains the entire Tax Code.

In my view, the plain text of the Omnibus Clause prohibits obstructing the due administration of the Tax Code in its entirety, not just particular IRS proceedings.
That limitation has no basis in the text.

As this Court recently reiterated, phrases such as "this title" most naturally refer to the cited provision "as a whole."
The words "this title" cannot be read to mean "only some of this title."

Congress used "this title" throughout Title 26 to refer to the Tax Code in its entirety.

Having failed to find its proposed limit in the text, the Court turns to context.
This Court cannot "lightly assume that Congress has omitted from its adopted text requirements that it nonetheless intends to apply."

However, its two contextual arguments fare no better.
Having failed to find its proposed limit in the text, the Court turns to context.

First, the Court contends that the Omnibus Clause must be limited to pending or imminent proceedings because the other clauses of ยง7212 are limited to actions "taken against individual identifiable persons or property."
However, its two contextual arguments fare no better.

But specific clauses in a statute typically do not limit the scope of a general omnibus clause.
First, the Court contends that the Omnibus Clause must be limited to pending or imminent proceedings because the other clauses of ยง7212 are limited to actions "taken against individual identifiable persons or property."

Nor do the other clauses in ยง7212 contain the pending-or-imminent-proceeding requirement that the Court reads into the Omnibus Clause.
But specific clauses in a statute typically do not limit the scope of a general omnibus clause.

They thus provide no support for the Court's atextual limitation.
Nor do the other clauses in ยง7212 contain the pending-or-imminent-proceeding requirement that the Court reads into the Omnibus Clause.

Second, the Court asserts that its reading prevents the Omnibus Clause from overlapping with certain misdemeanors in the Tax Code.
They thus provide no support for the Court's atextual limitation.

The Omnibus Clause requires that an act be done "corruptly," but the misdemeanor provisions require that an act be done "willfully."
But there is no redundancy problem because these provisions have different mens rea requirements.

In other words, "corruptly" requires proof that the defendant not only knew he was obtaining an "unlawful benefit" but that his "objective" or "purpose" was to obtain that unlawful benefit.
The difference between these mens rea requirements is significant.

The Court dismisses the significance of the different mens rea requirements, see ante, at 8, but this difference is important under basic principles of criminal law.
In other words, "corruptly" requires proof that the defendant not only knew he was obtaining an "unlawful benefit" but that his "objective" or "purpose" was to obtain that unlawful benefit.

The law recognizes that the same conduct, when committed with a higher mens rea, is more culpable and thus more deserving of punishment.
The Court dismisses the significance of the different mens rea requirements, see ante, at 8, but this difference is important under basic principles of criminal law.

For that reason, different mens rea requirements often differentiate culpability for the same conduct.
The law recognizes that the same conduct, when committed with a higher mens rea, is more culpable and thus more deserving of punishment.

Unless the Court means to cast doubt on this well-established principle, it should not casually dismiss the different mens rea requirements in the Omnibus Clause and the various misdemeanors in the Tax Code.
For that reason, different mens rea requirements often differentiate culpability for the same conduct.

Even if the Omnibus Clause did overlap with these other misdemeanors, that would prove little.
Unless the Court means to cast doubt on this well-established principle, it should not casually dismiss the different mens rea requirements in the Omnibus Clause and the various misdemeanors in the Tax Code.

In fact, the Court's interpretation of the Omnibus Clause does not eliminate the redundancy.
This Court has repeatedly declined to depart from the plain meaning of the text simply because the same conduct would be criminalized under two or more provisions.

Certain misdemeanor offenses in the Tax Code--such as failing to obey a summons, ยง7210--apply to conduct that takes place during a proceeding and, thus, would still violate the Omnibus Clause under the Court's interpretation.
In fact, the Court's interpretation of the Omnibus Clause does not eliminate the redundancy.

The Court's interpretation also makes the Omnibus Clause largely redundant with 18 U. S. C. ยง1505, which already prohibits "corruptly . . . endeavor[ing] to influence, obstruct, or impede the due and proper administration of the law under which any pending proceeding is being had before any department or agency of the United States."
Certain misdemeanor offenses in the Tax Code--such as failing to obey a summons, ยง7210--apply to conduct that takes place during a proceeding and, thus, would still violate the Omnibus Clause under the Court's interpretation.

Avoiding redundancy is thus not a reason to favor the Court's interpretation.

Avoiding redundancy is thus not a reason to favor the Court's interpretation.

The differences between the Omnibus Clause and those other obstruction statutes demonstrate why the former does not contain the Court's proceeding requirement.
The Court contends that its narrow reading of "due administration of this title" is supported by three decisions interpreting other obstruction statutes, though it admits that the "language and history" of the Omnibus Clause "differ somewhat" from those other obstruction provisions.

The omnibus clause of ยง1503 forbids corruptly endeavoring to obstruct "the due administration of justice."
The differences between the Omnibus Clause and those other obstruction statutes demonstrate why the former does not contain the Court's proceeding requirement.

But this nexus requirement was based on the specific history of ยง1503.
The Court concluded that this language requires the prosecution to prove a "nexus" between the defendant's obstructive act and "judicial proceedings."

The predecessor to that statute prohibited obstructing "the due administration of justice" "in any court of the United States."
But this nexus requirement was based on the specific history of ยง1503.

Based on this statutory history, the Court assumed that ยง1503 continued to refer to the administration of justice in a court.

None of that history is present here.

Relying on Aguilar, the Court concluded that ยง1512(b)(2)(A) required the Government to show a "nexus" with "[a] particular proceeding."
There the Court interpreted 18 U. S. C. ยง1512(b)(2)(A), which prohibits "knowingly . . . corruptly persuad[ing] another person . . . with intent to . . . cause or induce [that] person to . . . withhold testimony, or withhold a record, document, or other object, from an official proceeding."

But this nexus requirement came from the statutory text, which expressly included "an official proceeding."
Relying on Aguilar, the Court concluded that ยง1512(b)(2)(A) required the Government to show a "nexus" with "[a] particular proceeding."

If anything, then, ยง1512(b)(2)(A) cuts against the Court's interpretation of the Omnibus Clause because it shows that Congress knows how to impose a "proceeding" requirement when it wants to do so.
But this nexus requirement came from the statutory text, which expressly included "an official proceeding."

There the Court interpreted 18 U. S. C. ยง1519, which prohibits obstructing "the investigation or proper administration of any matter within the jurisdiction of any department or agency of the United States."
If anything, then, ยง1512(b)(2)(A) cuts against the Court's interpretation of the Omnibus Clause because it shows that Congress knows how to impose a "proceeding" requirement when it wants to do so.

The four Justices in the plurality recognized that this language made ยง1519 broader than other obstruction statutes: Section 1519 "covers conduct intended to impede any federal investigation or proceeding, including one not even on the verge of commencement."
There the Court interpreted 18 U. S. C. ยง1519, which prohibits obstructing "the investigation or proper administration of any matter within the jurisdiction of any department or agency of the United States."

The plurality contrasted the term "official proceeding" with the phrase "investigation or proper administration of any matter within the jurisdiction of any department or agency," noting that the latter is broader.
The four Justices in the plurality recognized that this language made ยง1519 broader than other obstruction statutes: Section 1519 "covers conduct intended to impede any federal investigation or proceeding, including one not even on the verge of commencement."

But we have never inserted such a requirement into an obstruction statute without textual or historical support.
In sum, these cases demonstrate that, when text and history justify it, this Court interprets obstruction statutes to include a proceeding requirement.

Today the Court does precisely that.
But we have never inserted such a requirement into an obstruction statute without textual or historical support.

All else having failed, the Court invokes lenity-sounding concerns to justify reading its proceeding requirement into the Omnibus Clause.
Today the Court does precisely that.

But the rule of lenity applies only if after applying ordinary tools of statutory interpretation, "there remains a grievous ambiguity or uncertainty in the statute such that the Court must simply guess as to what Congress intended."

The Court identifies no such grievous ambiguity in the Omnibus Clause, and breadth is not the same thing as ambiguity.

To be sure, ยง7212(a) is a sweeping obstruction statute.
It is hard to see how the Court's statute is less vague than the one Congress drafted, which simply instructed individuals not to corruptly obstruct or impede the IRS' administration of the Tax Code.

The Court frets that the Omnibus Clause might apply to "a person who pays a babysitter $41 per week in cash without withholding taxes," "leaves a large cash tip in a restaurant," "fails to keep donation receipts from every charity," or "fails to provide every record to an accountant."

Whether the Omnibus Clause would cover these hypotheticals--and whether the Government would waste its resources identifying and prosecuting them--is debatable.

Three preliminary issues require resolution.
The Alabama courts' determination that McWilliams received all the assistance to which Ake entitled him was contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law.

First, the conditions that trigger Ake's application are present.
Three preliminary issues require resolution.

McWilliams is and was an "indigent defendant," 470 U. S., at 70, and his "mental condition" was both "relevant to . . . the punishment he might suffer," id., at 80, and "seriously in question," id., at 70.

Second, this Court rejects Alabama's claim the State was relieved of its Ake obligations because McWilliams received brief assistance from a volunteer psychologist at the University of Alabama.

Even if the episodic help of an outside volunteer could satisfy Ake, the State does not refer to any specific record facts that indicate that the volunteer psychologist was available to the defense at the judicial sentencing proceeding.

Rather, he asked for additional help at the judicial sentencing hearing, but was rebuffed.

This Court does not have to decide whether Ake requires a State to provide an indigent defendant with a qualified mental health expert retained specifically for the defense team.

That is because Alabama did not meet even Ake's most basic requirements in this case.

Ake requires more than just an examination.
That is because Alabama did not meet even Ake's most basic requirements in this case.

Thirty-one years ago, petitioner James Edmond McWilliams, Jr., was convicted of capital murder by an Alabama jury and sentenced to death.
Justice Breyer delivered the opinion of the Court.

McWilliams challenged his sentence on appeal, arguing that the State had failed to provide him with the expert mental health assistance the Constitution requires, but the Alabama courts refused to grant relief.

Our decision in Ake v. Oklahoma, 470 U.

McWilliams and the State of Alabama agree that Ake (which this Court decided in February 1985) sets forth the applicable constitutional standards.
Petitioner in this case did not receive that assistance.

Before turning to the circumstances of McWilliams' case, we describe what the Court held in Ake.
McWilliams and the State of Alabama agree that Ake (which this Court decided in February 1985) sets forth the applicable constitutional standards.

We put in italics language that we find particularly pertinent here.
Before turning to the circumstances of McWilliams' case, we describe what the Court held in Ake.

The Court began by stating that the "issue in this case is whether the Constitution requires that an indigent defendant have access to the psychiatric examination and assistance necessary to prepare an effective defense based on his mental condition, when his sanity at the time of the offense is seriously in question."
We put in italics language that we find particularly pertinent here.

The Court said it would consider that issue within the framework of earlier cases granting "an indigent defendant . . . a fair opportunity to present his defense" and "to participate meaningfully in a judicial proceeding in which his liberty is at stake."
The Court began by stating that the "issue in this case is whether the Constitution requires that an indigent defendant have access to the psychiatric examination and assistance necessary to prepare an effective defense based on his mental condition, when his sanity at the time of the offense is seriously in question."

"Meaningful access to justice," the Court added, "has been the consistent theme of these cases."
The Court said it would consider that issue within the framework of earlier cases granting "an indigent defendant . . . a fair opportunity to present his defense" and "to participate meaningfully in a judicial proceeding in which his liberty is at stake."

The Court then wrote that "when the State has made the defendant's mental condition relevant to his criminal culpability and to the punishment he might suffer, the assistance of a psychiatrist may well be crucial to the defendant's ability to marshal his defense."
"Meaningful access to justice," the Court added, "has been the consistent theme of these cases."

A psychiatrist may, among other things, "gather facts," "analyze the information gathered and from it draw plausible conclusions," and "know the probative questions to ask of the opposing party's psychiatrists and how to interpret their answers."
The Court then wrote that "when the State has made the defendant's mental condition relevant to his criminal culpability and to the punishment he might suffer, the assistance of a psychiatrist may well be crucial to the defendant's ability to marshal his defense."

"lea[d] inexorably to the conclusion that, without the assistance of a psychiatrist to conduct a professional examination on issues relevant to the defense, to help determine whether the insanity defense is viable, to present testimony, and to assist in preparing the cross-examination of a State's psychiatric witnesses, the risk of an inaccurate resolution of sanity issues is extremely high.
A psychiatrist may, among other things, "gather facts," "analyze the information gathered and from it draw plausible conclusions," and "know the probative questions to ask of the opposing party's psychiatrists and how to interpret their answers."

With such assistance, the defendant is fairly able to present at least enough information to the jury, in a meaningful manner, as to permit it to make a sensible determination."
"lea[d] inexorably to the conclusion that, without the assistance of a psychiatrist to conduct a professional examination on issues relevant to the defense, to help determine whether the insanity defense is viable, to present testimony, and to assist in preparing the cross-examination of a State's psychiatric witnesses, the risk of an inaccurate resolution of sanity issues is extremely high.

The Court concluded: "We therefore hold that when a defendant demonstrates to the trial judge that his sanity at the time of the offense is to be a significant factor at trial, the State must, at a minimum, assure the defendant access to a competent psychiatrist who will conduct an appropriate examination and assist in evaluation, preparation, and presentation of the defense. . . .
With such assistance, the defendant is fairly able to present at least enough information to the jury, in a meaningful manner, as to permit it to make a sensible determination."

Our concern is that the indigent defendant have access to a competent psychiatrist for the[se] purpose[s]."

Ake thus clearly establishes that when its threshold criteria are met, a State must provide a mental health professional capable of performing a certain role: "conduct[ing] an appropriate examination and assist[ing] in evaluation, preparation, and presentation of the defense."
Our concern is that the indigent defendant have access to a competent psychiatrist for the[se] purpose[s]."

Unless a defendant is "assure[d]" the assistance of someone who can effectively perform these functions, he has not received the "minimum" to which Ake entitles him.

Dr. Nagi testified that he had found no evidence of psychosis, but did not appear to be aware of McWilliams' history of head trauma.
The prosecution then called two of the mental health professionals who had signed the Lunacy Commission's report, Dr. Kamal Nagi and Dr. Norman Poythress.

Dr. Nagi testified that he had found no evidence of psychosis, but did not appear to be aware of McWilliams' history of head trauma.

Although McWilliams' counsel had subpoenaed further mental health records from Holman State Prison, where McWilliams was being held, the jury did not have the opportunity to consider them, for, though subpoenaed on August 13, the records had not arrived by August 27, the day of the jury hearing.

That motion (apparently filed at the suggestion of a University of Alabama psychologist who had "volunteer[ed]" to help counsel "in her spare time," P. C. T. 251-252) asked the court to "issue an order requiring the State of Alabama to do complete neurological and neuropsychological testing on the Defendant in order to have the test results available for his sentencing hearing."
The court also granted McWilliams' motion for neurological and neuropsychological exams.

Consequently, Dr. John Goff, a neuropsychologist employed by the State's Department of Mental Health, examined McWilliams.

On October 7, two days before the judicial sentencing hearing, Dr. Goff filed his report.
Consequently, Dr. John Goff, a neuropsychologist employed by the State's Department of Mental Health, examined McWilliams.

The report concluded that McWilliams presented "some diagnostic dilemmas."
On October 7, two days before the judicial sentencing hearing, Dr. Goff filed his report.

On the one hand, he was "obviously attempting to appear emotionally disturbed" and "exaggerating his neuropsychological problems."
The report concluded that McWilliams presented "some diagnostic dilemmas."

But on the other hand, it was "quite apparent that he ha[d] some genuine neuropsychological problems."
On the one hand, he was "obviously attempting to appear emotionally disturbed" and "exaggerating his neuropsychological problems."

Tests revealed "cortical dysfunction attributable to right cerebral hemisphere dysfunction," shown by "left hand weakness, poor motor coordination of the left hand, sensory deficits including suppressions of the left hand and very poor visual search skills."
But on the other hand, it was "quite apparent that he ha[d] some genuine neuropsychological problems."

These deficiencies were "suggestive of a right hemisphere lesion" and "compatible with the injuries [McWilliams] sa[id] he sustained as a child."
Tests revealed "cortical dysfunction attributable to right cerebral hemisphere dysfunction," shown by "left hand weakness, poor motor coordination of the left hand, sensory deficits including suppressions of the left hand and very poor visual search skills."

The report added that McWilliams' "obvious neuropsychological deficit" could be related to his "low frustration tolerance and impulsivity," and suggested a diagnosis of "organic personality syndrome."
These deficiencies were "suggestive of a right hemisphere lesion" and "compatible with the injuries [McWilliams] sa[id] he sustained as a child."

The day before the sentencing hearing defense counsel also received updated records from Taylor Hardin hospital, and on the morning of the hearing he received the records (subpoenaed in mid-August) from Holman Prison.
The report added that McWilliams' "obvious neuropsychological deficit" could be related to his "low frustration tolerance and impulsivity," and suggested a diagnosis of "organic personality syndrome."

The prison records indicated that McWilliams was taking an assortment of psychotropic medications including Desyrel, Librium, and an antipsychotic, Mellaril.
The day before the sentencing hearing defense counsel also received updated records from Taylor Hardin hospital, and on the morning of the hearing he received the records (subpoenaed in mid-August) from Holman Prison.

The judicial sentencing hearing began on the morning of October 9.
The prison records indicated that McWilliams was taking an assortment of psychotropic medications including Desyrel, Librium, and an antipsychotic, Mellaril.

He said he needed more time to go over the new information.
Defense counsel told the trial court that the eleventh-hour arrival of the Goff report and the mental health records left him "unable to present any evidence today."

Furthermore, since he was "not a psychologist or a psychiatrist," he needed "to have someone else review these findings" and offer "a second opinion as to the severity of the organic problems discovered."
He said he needed more time to go over the new information.

Once it had finished, defense counsel moved for a continuance in order "to allow us to go through the material that has been provided to us in the last 2 days."
The prosecution then presented its case.

The judge offered to give defense counsel until 2 p.m. that afternoon.
Once it had finished, defense counsel moved for a continuance in order "to allow us to go through the material that has been provided to us in the last 2 days."

He also stated that "[a]t that time, The Court will entertain any motion that you may have with some other person to review" the new material.
The judge offered to give defense counsel until 2 p.m. that afternoon.

Defense counsel protested that "there is no way that I can go through this material," but the judge immediately added, "Well, I will give you the opportunity. . . .

If you do not want to try, then you may not."
Defense counsel protested that "there is no way that I can go through this material," but the judge immediately added, "Well, I will give you the opportunity. . . .

The court then adjourned until 2 p.m.
If you do not want to try, then you may not."

He said that "the abritrary [sic] position taken by this Court regarding the Defendant's right to present mitigating circumstances is unconscionable resulting in this proceeding being a mockery."
During the recess, defense counsel moved to withdraw.

He added that "further participation would be tantamount to exceptance [sic] of the Court's ruling."
He said that "the abritrary [sic] position taken by this Court regarding the Defendant's right to present mitigating circumstances is unconscionable resulting in this proceeding being a mockery."

When the proceedings resumed, defense counsel renewed his motion for a continuance, explaining,
The trial court denied the motion to withdraw.

"It is the position of the Defense that we have received these records at such a late date, such a late time that it has put us in a position as laymen, with regard to psychological matters, that we cannot adequately make a determination as what to present to The Court with regards to the particular deficiencies that the Defendant has.
When the proceedings resumed, defense counsel renewed his motion for a continuance, explaining,

We believe that he has the type of diagnosed illness that we pointed out earlier for The Court and have mentioned for The Court.
"It is the position of the Defense that we have received these records at such a late date, such a late time that it has put us in a position as laymen, with regard to psychological matters, that we cannot adequately make a determination as what to present to The Court with regards to the particular deficiencies that the Defendant has.

But we cannot determine ourselves from the records that we have received and the lack of receiving the test and the lack of our own expertise, whether or not such a condition exists; whether the reports and tests that have been run by Taylor Hardin, and the Lunacy Commission, and at Holman are tests that should be challenged in some type of way or the results should be challenged, we really need an opportunity to have the right type of experts in this field, take a look at all of those records and tell us what is happening with him.
We believe that he has the type of diagnosed illness that we pointed out earlier for The Court and have mentioned for The Court.

And that is why we renew the Motion for a Continuance."

The trial court denied the motion.
And that is why we renew the Motion for a Continuance."

Defense counsel replied that he "would be pleased to respond to [the prosecutor's] remarks that there are no mitigating circumstances in this case if I were able to have time to produce . . . any mitigating circumstances."
The prosecutor then offered his closing statement, in which he argued that there were "no mitigating circumstances."

But, he said, since neither he nor his co-counsel were "doctors," neither was "really capable of going through those records on our own."
Defense counsel replied that he "would be pleased to respond to [the prosecutor's] remarks that there are no mitigating circumstances in this case if I were able to have time to produce . . . any mitigating circumstances."

The court had thus "foreclosed by structuring this hearing as it has, the Defendant from presenting any evidence of mitigation in psychological--psychiatric terms."
But, he said, since neither he nor his co-counsel were "doctors," neither was "really capable of going through those records on our own."

The trial judge then said that he had reviewed the records himself and found evidence that McWilliams was faking and manipulative.
The court had thus "foreclosed by structuring this hearing as it has, the Defendant from presenting any evidence of mitigation in psychological--psychiatric terms."

Defense counsel attempted to contest that point, which led to the following exchange:
The trial judge then said that he had reviewed the records himself and found evidence that McWilliams was faking and manipulative.

"MR. SOGOL: I told Your Honor that my looking at those records was not of any value to me; that I needed to have somebody look at those records who understood them, who could interpret them for me.
Defense counsel attempted to contest that point, which led to the following exchange:

Did I not tell Your Honor that?
"MR. SOGOL: I told Your Honor that my looking at those records was not of any value to me; that I needed to have somebody look at those records who understood them, who could interpret them for me.

THE COURT: As I said, on the record earlier, Mr. Sogol, and I don't want to argue or belabor this, but I would have given you the opportunity to make a motion to present someone to evaluate that.
Did I not tell Your Honor that?

MR. SOGOL: Your Honor gave me no time in which to do that.
THE COURT: As I said, on the record earlier, Mr. Sogol, and I don't want to argue or belabor this, but I would have given you the opportunity to make a motion to present someone to evaluate that.

Your Honor told me to be here at 2 o'clock this afternoon.
MR. SOGOL: Your Honor gave me no time in which to do that.

Would Your Honor have wanted me to file a Motion for Extraordinary Expenses to get someone?
Your Honor told me to be here at 2 o'clock this afternoon.

THE COURT: I want you to approach with your client, please."
Would Your Honor have wanted me to file a Motion for Extraordinary Expenses to get someone?

The court then sentenced McWilliams to death.
THE COURT: I want you to approach with your client, please."

The court later issued a written sentencing order.
The court then sentenced McWilliams to death.

It found three aggravating circumstances and no mitigating circumstances.
The court later issued a written sentencing order.

It found that McWilliams "was not and is not psychotic," and that "the preponderance of the evidence from these tests and reports show [McWilliams] to be feigning, faking, and manipulative."
It found three aggravating circumstances and no mitigating circumstances.

The court wrote that even if McWilliams' mental health issues "did rise to the level of a mitigating circumstance, the aggravating circumstances would far outweigh this as a mitigating circumstance."
It found that McWilliams "was not and is not psychotic," and that "the preponderance of the evidence from these tests and reports show [McWilliams] to be feigning, faking, and manipulative."

McWilliams appealed, arguing that the trial court had denied him the right to meaningful expert assistance guaranteed by Ake.

The Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals rejected his argument.
McWilliams appealed, arguing that the trial court had denied him the right to meaningful expert assistance guaranteed by Ake.

It wrote that Ake's requirements "are met when the State provides the [defendant] with a competent psychiatrist."
The Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals rejected his argument.

The court added that "[t]here is no indication in the record that [McWilliams] could not have called Dr. Goff as a witness to explain his findings or that he even tried to contact the psychiatrist to discuss his findings," ibid.; that "the trial court indicated that it would have considered a motion to present an expert to evaluate this report" had one been made, ibid.; and that there was "no prejudice by the trial court's denial of [McWilliams'] motion for continuance," id., at 993.
It wrote that Ake's requirements "are met when the State provides the [defendant] with a competent psychiatrist."

The appeals court therefore affirmed McWilliams' conviction and sentence.

The Alabama Supreme Court, in turn, affirmed the appeals court (without addressing the Ake issue).
The appeals court therefore affirmed McWilliams' conviction and sentence.

In federal habeas court McWilliams argued before a Magistrate Judge that he had not received the expert assistance that Ake required.
After McWilliams failed to obtain postconviction relief from the state courts, he sought a federal writ of habeas corpus.

The Magistrate Judge recommended against issuing the writ.
In federal habeas court McWilliams argued before a Magistrate Judge that he had not received the expert assistance that Ake required.

He wrote that McWilliams had "received the assistance required by Ake" because Dr. Goff "completed the testing" that McWilliams requested.
The Magistrate Judge recommended against issuing the writ.

Hence, the decision of the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals was not contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law.
He wrote that McWilliams had "received the assistance required by Ake" because Dr. Goff "completed the testing" that McWilliams requested.

The District Court adopted the Magistrate Judge's report and recommendation and denied relief.
Hence, the decision of the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals was not contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law.

A divided panel of the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed.
The District Court adopted the Magistrate Judge's report and recommendation and denied relief.

The question before us is whether the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals' determination that McWilliams got all the assistance to which Ake entitled him was "contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law."
McWilliams filed a petition for certiorari.

Before turning to the heart of that question, we resolve three preliminary issues.
The question before us is whether the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals' determination that McWilliams got all the assistance to which Ake entitled him was "contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law."

First, no one denies that the conditions that trigger application of Ake are present.
Before turning to the heart of that question, we resolve three preliminary issues.

McWilliams is and was an "indigent defendant," 470 U. S., at 70.
First, no one denies that the conditions that trigger application of Ake are present.

His "mental condition" was "relevant to . . . the punishment he might suffer," 470 U. S., at 80.
McWilliams is and was an "indigent defendant," 470 U. S., at 70.

And, that "mental condition," i.e., his "sanity at the time of the offense," was "seriously in question," 470 U. S., at 70.
His "mental condition" was "relevant to . . . the punishment he might suffer," 470 U. S., at 80.

Consequently, the Constitution, as interpreted in Ake, required the State to provide McWilliams with "access to a competent psychiatrist who will conduct an appropriate examination and assist in evaluation, preparation, and presentation of the defense."
And, that "mental condition," i.e., his "sanity at the time of the offense," was "seriously in question," 470 U. S., at 70.

Second, we reject Alabama's claim that the State was exempted from its obligations because McWilliams already had the assistance of Dr. Rosenszweig, the psychologist at the University of Alabama who "volunteer[ed]" to help defense counsel "in her spare time" and suggested the defense ask for further testing, P. C. T. 251-252.
Consequently, the Constitution, as interpreted in Ake, required the State to provide McWilliams with "access to a competent psychiatrist who will conduct an appropriate examination and assist in evaluation, preparation, and presentation of the defense."

Even if the episodic assistance of an outside volunteer could relieve the State of its constitutional duty to ensure an indigent defendant access to meaningful expert assistance, no lower court has held or suggested that Dr. Rosenszweig was available to help, or might have helped, McWilliams at the judicial sentencing proceeding, the proceeding here at issue.

C. T. 251-252.

Alabama does not refer to any specific record facts that indicate that she was available to the defense at this time.
Even if the episodic assistance of an outside volunteer could relieve the State of its constitutional duty to ensure an indigent defendant access to meaningful expert assistance, no lower court has held or suggested that Dr. Rosenszweig was available to help, or might have helped, McWilliams at the judicial sentencing proceeding, the proceeding here at issue.

Third, Alabama argues that Ake's requirements are irrelevant because McWilliams "never asked for more expert assistance" than he got, "even though the trial court gave him the opportunity to do so."
Alabama does not refer to any specific record facts that indicate that she was available to the defense at this time.

The record does not support this contention.
Third, Alabama argues that Ake's requirements are irrelevant because McWilliams "never asked for more expert assistance" than he got, "even though the trial court gave him the opportunity to do so."

Counsel also explicitly asked the trial court what else he was supposed to ask for to obtain an expert: "Would Your Honor have wanted me to file a Motion for Extraordinary Expenses to get someone?"
When defense counsel requested a continuance at the sentencing hearing, he repeatedly told the court that he needed "to have someone else review" the Goff report and medical records.

We have reproduced a lengthier account of the exchanges, supra, at 7-9.
Counsel also explicitly asked the trial court what else he was supposed to ask for to obtain an expert: "Would Your Honor have wanted me to file a Motion for Extraordinary Expenses to get someone?"

They make clear that counsel wanted additional expert assistance to review the report and records--that was the point of asking for a continuance.
We have reproduced a lengthier account of the exchanges, supra, at 7-9.

In response, the court told counsel to approach the bench and sentenced McWilliams to death.
They make clear that counsel wanted additional expert assistance to review the report and records--that was the point of asking for a continuance.

Thus the record, in our view, indicates that McWilliams did request additional help from mental health experts.
In response, the court told counsel to approach the bench and sentenced McWilliams to death.

We turn to the main question before us: whether the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals' determination that McWilliams got all the assistance that Ake requires was "contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law."
Thus the record, in our view, indicates that McWilliams did request additional help from mental health experts.

McWilliams would have us answer "yes" on the ground that Ake clearly established that a State must provide an indigent defendant with a qualified mental health expert retained specifically for the defense team, not a neutral expert available to both parties.
We turn to the main question before us: whether the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals' determination that McWilliams got all the assistance that Ake requires was "contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law."

He points to language in Ake that seems to foresee that consequence.
McWilliams would have us answer "yes" on the ground that Ake clearly established that a State must provide an indigent defendant with a qualified mental health expert retained specifically for the defense team, not a neutral expert available to both parties.

As discussed above, Ake clearly established that a defendant must receive the assistance of a mental health expert who is sufficiently available to the defense and independent from the prosecution to effectively "assist in evaluation, preparation, and presentation of the defense."
We need not, and do not, decide, however, whether this particular McWilliams claim is correct.

As a practical matter, the simplest way for a State to meet this standard may be to provide a qualified expert retained specifically for the defense team.
As discussed above, Ake clearly established that a defendant must receive the assistance of a mental health expert who is sufficiently available to the defense and independent from the prosecution to effectively "assist in evaluation, preparation, and presentation of the defense."

This appears to be the approach that the overwhelming majority of jurisdictions have adopted.
As a practical matter, the simplest way for a State to meet this standard may be to provide a qualified expert retained specifically for the defense team.

It is not necessary, however, for us to decide whether the Constitution requires States to satisfy Ake's demands in this way.

That is because Alabama here did not meet even Ake's most basic requirements.
It is not necessary, however, for us to decide whether the Constitution requires States to satisfy Ake's demands in this way.

The dissent calls our unwillingness to resolve the broader question whether Ake clearly established a right to an expert independent from the prosecution a "most unseemly maneuver."
That is because Alabama here did not meet even Ake's most basic requirements.

We recognize that we granted petitioner's first question presented--which addressed whether Ake clearly established a right to an independent expert--and not his second, which raised more case-specific concerns.
The dissent calls our unwillingness to resolve the broader question whether Ake clearly established a right to an expert independent from the prosecution a "most unseemly maneuver."

Yet that does not bind us to issue a sweeping ruling when a narrow one will do.
We recognize that we granted petitioner's first question presented--which addressed whether Ake clearly established a right to an independent expert--and not his second, which raised more case-specific concerns.

As we explain below, our determination that Ake clearly established that a defendant must receive the assistance of a mental health expert who is sufficiently available to the defense and independent from the prosecution to effectively "assist in evaluation, preparation, and presentation of the defense," 470 U. S., at 83, is sufficient to resolve the case.
Yet that does not bind us to issue a sweeping ruling when a narrow one will do.

We therefore need not decide whether Ake clearly established more.
As we explain below, our determination that Ake clearly established that a defendant must receive the assistance of a mental health expert who is sufficiently available to the defense and independent from the prosecution to effectively "assist in evaluation, preparation, and presentation of the defense," 470 U.

In fact, the State devoted an entire section of its merits brief to explaining why it thought that "[n]o matter how the Court resolves the [independent expert] question, the court of appeals correctly denied the habeas petition."
We therefore need not decide whether Ake clearly established more.

The Alabama appeals court held that "the requirements of Ake v. Oklahoma . . . are met when the State provides the [defendant] with a competent psychiatrist.
In fact, the State devoted an entire section of its merits brief to explaining why it thought that "[n]o matter how the Court resolves the [independent expert] question, the court of appeals correctly denied the habeas petition."

The State met this requirement in allowing Dr. Goff to examine [McWilliams]."
The Alabama appeals court held that "the requirements of Ake v. Oklahoma . . . are met when the State provides the [defendant] with a competent psychiatrist.

Ake does not require just an examination.
The State met this requirement in allowing Dr. Goff to examine [McWilliams]."

Rather, it requires the State to provide the defense with "access to a competent psychiatrist who will conduct an appropriate [1] examination and assist in [2] evaluation, [3] preparation, and [4] presentation of the defense."
Ake does not require just an examination.

We are willing to assume that Alabama met the examination portion of this requirement by providing for Dr. Goff's examination of McWilliams.
Rather, it requires the State to provide the defense with "access to a competent psychiatrist who will conduct an appropriate [1] examination and assist in [2] evaluation, [3] preparation, and [4] presentation of the defense."

Neither Dr. Goff nor any other expert helped the defense evaluate Goff's report or McWilliams' extensive medical records and translate these data into a legal strategy.
But what about the other three parts?

Neither Dr. Goff nor any other expert helped the defense prepare and present arguments that might, for example, have explained that McWilliams' purported malingering was not necessarily inconsistent with mental illness (as an expert later testified in postconviction proceedings, see P. C. T. 936-943).
Neither Dr. Goff nor any other expert helped the defense evaluate Goff's report or McWilliams' extensive medical records and translate these data into a legal strategy.

Neither Dr. Goff nor any other expert helped the defense prepare direct or cross-examination of any witnesses, or testified at the judicial sentencing hearing himself.
Neither Dr. Goff nor any other expert helped the defense prepare and present arguments that might, for example, have explained that McWilliams' purported malingering was not necessarily inconsistent with mental illness (as an expert later testified in postconviction proceedings, see P. C. T. 936-943).

The dissent emphasizes that Dr. Goff was never ordered to do any of these things by the trial court.
Neither Dr. Goff nor any other expert helped the defense prepare direct or cross-examination of any witnesses, or testified at the judicial sentencing hearing himself.

But that is precisely the point.
The dissent emphasizes that Dr. Goff was never ordered to do any of these things by the trial court.

It only required "the Department of Corrections" to "complete neurological and neuropsychological testing on the Defendant . . . and send all test materials, results and evaluations to the Clerk of the Court."
The relevant court order did not ask Dr. Goff or anyone else to provide the defense with help in evaluating, preparing, and presenting its case.

(Indeed, given that timeframe, we do not see how Dr. Goff or any other expert could have satisfied the latter three portions of Ake's requirements even had he been instructed to do so.)
Nor did the short time frame allow for more expert assistance.

Then, when McWilliams asked for the additional assistance to which he was constitutionally entitled at the sentencing hearing, the judge rebuffed his requests.
(Indeed, given that timeframe, we do not see how Dr. Goff or any other expert could have satisfied the latter three portions of Ake's requirements even had he been instructed to do so.)

Since Alabama's provision of mental health assistance fell so dramatically short of what Ake requires, we must conclude that the Alabama court decision affirming McWilliams's conviction and sentence was "contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law."
Then, when McWilliams asked for the additional assistance to which he was constitutionally entitled at the sentencing hearing, the judge rebuffed his requests.

The Eleventh Circuit held in the alternative that, even if the Alabama courts clearly erred in their application of federal law, their "error" nonetheless did not have the "substantial and injurious effect or influence" required to warrant a grant of habeas relief, Davis v. Ayala, 576 U. S. ___, ___ (2015) (slip op., at 10) (internal quotation marks omitted).

In reaching this conclusion, however, the Eleventh Circuit only considered whether "[a] few additional days to review Dr. Goff's findings" would have made a difference.

There is reason to think that it could have.

For example, the trial judge relied heavily on his belief that McWilliams was malingering.

on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit

We granted review in this case to decide a straightforward legal question on which the lower courts are divided: whether our decision in Ake v. Oklahoma, 470 U. S. 68 (1985), clearly established that an indigent defendant whose mental health will be a significant factor at trial is entitled to the assistance of a psychiatric expert who is a member of the defense team instead of a neutral expert who is available to assist both the prosecution and the defense.1
Justice Alito, with whom The Chief Justice, Justice Thomas, and Justice Gorsuch join, dissenting.

The answer to that question is plain: Ake did not clearly establish that a defendant is entitled to an expert who is a member of the defense team.

Put another way, "[w]hen reviewing state criminal convictions on collateral review, federal judges are required to afford state courts due respect by overturning their decisions only when there could be no reasonable dispute that they were wrong."
It requires habeas petitioners to "show that the state court's ruling on the claim . . . was so lacking in justification that there was an error well understood and comprehended in existing law beyond any possibility for fairminded disagreement."

In Ake, we held that a defendant must be provided "access to a competent psychiatrist" in two circumstances: first, "when [the] defendant demonstrates to the trial judge that his sanity at the time of the offense is to be a significant factor at trial," and, second, at the sentencing phase of a capital trial, "when the State presents psychiatric evidence of the defendant's future dangerousness."

The question that we agreed to review concerns the type of expert that must be provided.

Did Ake clearly establish that a defendant in the two situations just noted must be provided with the services of an expert who functions solely as a dedicated member of the defense team as opposed to a neutral expert who examines the defendant, reports his or her conclusions to the court and the parties, and is available to assist and testify for both sides?
The question that we agreed to review concerns the type of expert that must be provided.

Did Ake speak with such clarity that it ruled out "any possibility for fairminded disagreement"?

Did Ake speak with such clarity that it ruled out "any possibility for fairminded disagreement"?

It is certainly true that there is language in Ake that points toward the position that a defense-team psychiatrist should be provided.
Ake provides no clear guidance one way or the other.

Explaining the need for the appointment of a psychiatric expert, Ake noted that a psychiatrist can "assist in preparing the cross-examination of a State's psychiatric witnesses" and would "know the probative questions to ask of the opposing party's psychiatrists and how to interpret their answers."
It is certainly true that there is language in Ake that points toward the position that a defense-team psychiatrist should be provided.

And when Ake discussed expert assistance during capital sentencing, the Court said that it is important for a defendant to "offer a well-informed expert's opposing view" in the form of "responsive psychiatric testimony."

And when Ake discussed expert assistance during capital sentencing, the Court said that it is important for a defendant to "offer a well-informed expert's opposing view" in the form of "responsive psychiatric testimony."

While it is possible for a neutral expert to provide these services, in our adversary system they are customarily performed by an expert working exclusively for one of the parties.
Ake also explained that factfinding is improved when evidence is offered by "psychiatrists for each party."

Ake was clear that an indigent defendant does not have a constitutional right to "choose a psychiatrist of his personal liking or . . . receive funds to hire his own."
Other language in Ake, however, points at least as strongly in the opposite direction.

Instead, the Court held only that a defendant is entitled to have "access" to "one competent psychiatrist" chosen by the trial judge.
Ake was clear that an indigent defendant does not have a constitutional right to "choose a psychiatrist of his personal liking or . . . receive funds to hire his own."

These limitations are at odds with the defense-expert model, which McWilliams characterizes as "the norm in our adversarial system."
Instead, the Court held only that a defendant is entitled to have "access" to "one competent psychiatrist" chosen by the trial judge.

As McWilliams explains, "other litigants of means" screen experts to find one whose tentative views are favorable, and they often hire both consulting and testifying experts.
These limitations are at odds with the defense-expert model, which McWilliams characterizes as "the norm in our adversarial system."

But the Ake Court was clear that it was not holding "that a State must purchase for the indigent defendant all the assistance that his wealthier counterpart might buy."
As McWilliams explains, "other litigants of means" screen experts to find one whose tentative views are favorable, and they often hire both consulting and testifying experts.

On the contrary, Ake expressly stated that a State need only provide for a single psychiatric expert to be selected by the trial judge.
But the Ake Court was clear that it was not holding "that a State must purchase for the indigent defendant all the assistance that his wealthier counterpart might buy."

Thus, Ake does not give the defense the right to interview potential experts, to seek out an expert who offers a favorable preliminary diagnosis, or to hire more than one expert.
On the contrary, Ake expressly stated that a State need only provide for a single psychiatric expert to be selected by the trial judge.

And if the court-appointed expert reaches a conclusion unfavorable to the defendant on the issue of sanity or future dangerousness, Ake requires the defense team to live with the expert's unfavorable conclusions.
Thus, Ake does not give the defense the right to interview potential experts, to seek out an expert who offers a favorable preliminary diagnosis, or to hire more than one expert.

As McWilliams concedes, when the only expert available to indigent defendants is one selected by the trial court, these defendants "face a risk that their expert will ultimately be unwilling or unable to offer testimony that will advance their cause."

While Ake also declared that Baldi did not limit the Court "in considering whether fundamental fairness today requires a different result," 470 U. S., at 85, Ake did not explicitly overrule Baldi, and ultimately its treatment of that case was "most ambiguous," LaFave ยง8.2, at 450, n. 124.

It is also significant that the Ake Court had no need to decide whether due process requires the appointment of a defense-team expert as opposed to a neutral expert because Ake was denied the assistance of any psychiatrist--neutral or otherwise--for purposes of assessing his sanity at the time of the offense or his mental state as it related to capital sentencing.

Denying Alabama that chance does not show "[a] proper respect for AEDPA's high bar for habeas relief," which counsels restraint in "disturbing the State's significant interest in repose for concluded litigation, denying society the right to punish some admitted offenders, and intruding on state sovereignty to a degree matched by few exercises of federal authority."

Had the Court confronted the harmless-error issue, it would have found it difficult to reject the Court of Appeals' conclusion that any Ake error here was harmless.
Moreover, unlike the question that the majority does decide, the harmless-error issue was at least briefed in a meaningful way by the parties.

Reynolds was a clerk at a convenience store in Tuscaloosa, Alabama.
In 1984, McWilliams "raped, robbed, and murdered Patricia Vallery Reynolds."

McWilliams robbed the store, brutally raped Reynolds in a back room, then left her on the floor to die after shooting her six times execution style with a .38 caliber pistol.
Reynolds was a clerk at a convenience store in Tuscaloosa, Alabama.

After McWilliams was apprehended, he bragged to other jail inmates about what he had done.
McWilliams robbed the store, brutally raped Reynolds in a back room, then left her on the floor to die after shooting her six times execution style with a .38 caliber pistol.

The jury needed less than an hour of deliberation to find him guilty, and it recommended the death penalty by a 10-to-2 vote the following day.
After McWilliams was apprehended, he bragged to other jail inmates about what he had done.

Agreeing with the jury's nonbinding recommendation, the trial court imposed the death penalty based on three aggravating circumstances.
The jury needed less than an hour of deliberation to find him guilty, and it recommended the death penalty by a 10-to-2 vote the following day.

McWilliams had prior violent felony convictions for first-degree robbery and first-degree rape.
Agreeing with the jury's nonbinding recommendation, the trial court imposed the death penalty based on three aggravating circumstances.

He murdered Reynolds in the course of committing a robbery and rape.
McWilliams had prior violent felony convictions for first-degree robbery and first-degree rape.

And his crime "was especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel": He executed the only potential eyewitness to his robbery, and his conduct during and after the crime showed an "obvious lack of regard or compassion for the life and human dignity of the victim."
He murdered Reynolds in the course of committing a robbery and rape.

Balanced against these three aggravators was McWilliams's claim that he was psychotic and suffered from organic brain dysfunction--the mitigating evidence that Dr. Goff's report supposedly would have supported.
And his crime "was especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel": He executed the only potential eyewitness to his robbery, and his conduct during and after the crime showed an "obvious lack of regard or compassion for the life and human dignity of the victim."

But the sentencing court concluded that this evidence "did not rise to the level of a mitigating circumstance," in part because of the extensive evidence that McWilliams was feigning symptoms.
Balanced against these three aggravators was McWilliams's claim that he was psychotic and suffered from organic brain dysfunction--the mitigating evidence that Dr. Goff's report supposedly would have supported.

And in any event, the sentencing court found that "the aggravating circumstances would far outweigh this as a mitigating circumstance."
But the sentencing court concluded that this evidence "did not rise to the level of a mitigating circumstance," in part because of the extensive evidence that McWilliams was feigning symptoms.

The majority hints that the sentencing court's weighing might have been different if McWilliams had been afforded more time to work with Dr. Goff to prepare a mitigation presentation and to introduce Dr. Goff's testimony at the sentencing hearing.
And in any event, the sentencing court found that "the aggravating circumstances would far outweigh this as a mitigating circumstance."

The defense would have faced potential rebuttal testimony from three doctors who evaluated McWilliams and firmly concluded that McWilliams's mental state did not reduce his responsibility for his actions.
But there is little basis for this belief.

Certified Trial Record 1545 (Dr. Yumul) (McWilliams "was responsible and free of mental illness at the time of the alleged offense"); id., at 1546 (Dr. Nagi) (McWilliams "was not suffering from a mental illness" at the time of the crime and "[t]here see[m] to be no mitigating circumstances involved in [his] case"); ibid.

One of these psychiatrists also concluded that McWilliams was "grossly exaggerating his psychological symptoms to mimic mental illness" and that he "obviously" did so "to evade criminal prosecution."
(Dr. Bryant) (finding no "evidence of psychiatric symptoms of other illness that would provide a basis for mitigating factors at the time of the alleged crime").

Even Dr. Goff found it "quite obvious" that McWilliams's "symptoms of psychiatric disturbance [were] quite exaggerated and, perhaps, feigned."
One of these psychiatrists also concluded that McWilliams was "grossly exaggerating his psychological symptoms to mimic mental illness" and that he "obviously" did so "to evade criminal prosecution."

In light of all this, the defense would have faced an uphill battle in convincing the sentencing judge that, despite McWilliams's consistent malingering, his mental health was so impaired that it constituted a mitigating circumstance and that it outweighed the three aggravators the State proved.
Even Dr. Goff found it "quite obvious" that McWilliams's "symptoms of psychiatric disturbance [were] quite exaggerated and, perhaps, feigned."

If the sentencing judge had thought that there was a possibility that hearing from Dr. Goff would change his evaluation of aggravating and mitigating factors, he could have granted a continuance and called for Dr. Goff to appear.
In light of all this, the defense would have faced an uphill battle in convincing the sentencing judge that, despite McWilliams's consistent malingering, his mental health was so impaired that it constituted a mitigating circumstance and that it outweighed the three aggravators the State proved.

But he did not do so.
If the sentencing judge had thought that there was a possibility that hearing from Dr. Goff would change his evaluation of aggravating and mitigating factors, he could have granted a continuance and called for Dr. Goff to appear.

The majority also ignores the fact that McWilliams has already had the chance to show that the outcome of the sentencing proceeding would have been different if he had been given more expert assistance.
But he did not do so.

In state postconviction proceedings, McWilliams argued that he was denied effective assistance of counsel because his lawyers did not obtain an expert who would have fully probed his mental state for purposes of mitigation.
The majority also ignores the fact that McWilliams has already had the chance to show that the outcome of the sentencing proceeding would have been different if he had been given more expert assistance.

McWilliams called an expert, Dr. Woods, who offered the opinion that McWilliams suffered from bipolar disorder at the time of the crime and testified that McWilliams's exaggeration of symptoms was not inconsistent with psychiatric problems.
In state postconviction proceedings, McWilliams argued that he was denied effective assistance of counsel because his lawyers did not obtain an expert who would have fully probed his mental state for purposes of mitigation.

But Dr. Woods also acknowledged that McWilliams "tr[ied] to malinger for purposes of making himself look worse than he is," agreed that this malingering could have been done for the purpose of avoiding the death penalty, and declined to say that McWilliams's disorder explains why he raped and murdered Reynolds.
McWilliams called an expert, Dr. Woods, who offered the opinion that McWilliams suffered from bipolar disorder at the time of the crime and testified that McWilliams's exaggeration of symptoms was not inconsistent with psychiatric problems.

The State introduced a psychologist of its own (Dr. Kirkland) who strenuously disagreed with Dr. Woods's diagnosis and concluded that nothing "indicate[s] that Mr. McWilliams was mentally impaired on the night of the offense."
Dr. Woods even endorsed Dr. Goff's conclusion that McWilliams "exaggerated certain aspects of his impairment."

At the end of a lengthy hearing in which both experts addressed the malingering issue (see, e.g., id., at 935-943, 955, 964-966, 1076-1077), the state postconviction court found that "McWilliams's claims based upon the testimony of Dr. Woods are without merit."
The State introduced a psychologist of its own (Dr. Kirkland) who strenuously disagreed with Dr. Woods's diagnosis and concluded that nothing "indicate[s] that Mr. McWilliams was mentally impaired on the night of the offense."

It expressly found that "both the credibility of Dr. Woods and the reliability of his findings are questionable."

The Court's decision represents an inexcusable departure from sound practice.
I see no ground for disturbing the Eleventh Circuit's decision on harmless error.7

Defending its approach, the Court says that it had no need to decide the "sweeping" question on which review was granted "when a narrow one will do."
The question was worded as follows: "When this Court held in Ake that an indigent defendant is entitled to meaningful expert assistance for the 'evaluation, preparation, and presentation of the defense,' did it clearly establish that the expert should be independent of the prosecution?"

Narrow holdings have their place, but here: (1) We denied review of the narrow question; (2) the question decided is not just narrow, it is the sort of factbound question as to which review is disfavored, see this Court's Rule 10; (3) the narrow question is not fairly included in the question presented, see this Court's Rule 14(a); (4) deciding the case on this narrow ground leaves in place the conflict in the lower courts that supported the grant of certiorari; and (5) the parties were not given notice of this possible disposition, and the Court was thus deprived of the benefit of full briefing and argument on the issue.
Defending its approach, the Court says that it had no need to decide the "sweeping" question on which review was granted "when a narrow one will do."

The Sixth Circuit's experience, standing alone, is a telling reflection of Ake's ambiguity.

Years after Kordenbrock, a Sixth Circuit panel held that Ake requires a defense expert.

A later panel insisted that "Ake does not entitle [defendants] to . . . an [independent psychiatric] expert," but to "a 'friend of the court' appointment."

The Court is incorrect in suggesting that Alabama "devoted an entire section of its merits brief" to the question that the Court decides.
The Sixth Circuit ultimately concluded that Ake did not itself clearly compel an answer to this question for AEDPA purposes.

In the section to which the Court refers, Alabama argued that even if McWilliams was entitled to relief under Ake to a partisan expert, no relief was warranted because he "had a consulting expert that did not report to the State," i.e. "a psychologist employed at the University of Alabama," and because the trial court ordered every form of testing that the defense requested.
The Court is incorrect in suggesting that Alabama "devoted an entire section of its merits brief" to the question that the Court decides.

Exactly six sentences of the State's briefing in this section, id., at 52, touch on the services provided by Dr. Goff and the trial court's denial of a continuance.

The State's inclusion of this fleeting discussion cannot justify a decision based on a question on which relief was denied.
Exactly six sentences of the State's briefing in this section, id., at 52, touch on the services provided by Dr. Goff and the trial court's denial of a continuance.

The Court never even recites the applicable standard: whether the Alabama courts erred beyond fairminded disagreement in rejecting McWilliams's claim under Ake v. Oklahoma, 470 U. S. 68 (1985).
The State's inclusion of this fleeting discussion cannot justify a decision based on a question on which relief was denied.

This bar is difficult for a habeas petitioner to hurdle, and it is far from clear that McWilliams has done so.
The Court never even recites the applicable standard: whether the Alabama courts erred beyond fairminded disagreement in rejecting McWilliams's claim under Ake v. Oklahoma, 470 U. S. 68 (1985).

The Court says that Dr. Goff did not play the role Ake requires of an expert because he only examined McWilliams and reported his findings to the trial court.

But that is exactly what the trial court (at McWilliams's request) ordered him to do.
The Court says that Dr. Goff did not play the role Ake requires of an expert because he only examined McWilliams and reported his findings to the trial court.

The Court briskly concludes that Dr. Goff did not assist the defense in understanding his report prior to the hearing or testify for McWilliams at the judicial sentencing hearing.
But that is exactly what the trial court (at McWilliams's request) ordered him to do.

But the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals found "no indication in the record that [McWilliams] could not have called Dr. Goff as a witness to explain his findings or that he even tried to contact the psychiatrist to discuss his findings."
The Court briskly concludes that Dr. Goff did not assist the defense in understanding his report prior to the hearing or testify for McWilliams at the judicial sentencing hearing.

And the Eleventh Circuit saw no reason why McWilliams's defense team could not have been in contact with Dr. Goff while he was preparing the report.

Dr. Goff was notably absent from the postconviction proceeding.
And the Eleventh Circuit saw no reason why McWilliams's defense team could not have been in contact with Dr. Goff while he was preparing the report.

McWilliams's failure to call him as a witness there creates a "void in the record" that prevents McWilliams from carrying his burden of showing "how additional time with Dr. Goff (and his report) would have benefited the defense."
Dr. Goff was notably absent from the postconviction proceeding.

It also suggests that, to McWilliams's postconviction counsel, Dr. Goff 's diagnosis and the opportunity to present it to the sentencer was not as important as McWilliams suggests.

Ake held that the right to a psychiatric expert at capital sentencing comes into play "when the State presents psychiatric evidence of the defendant's future dangerousness."

Here, the State did not introduce such evidence because future dangerousness was not an aggravator under Alabama law.
Ake held that the right to a psychiatric expert at capital sentencing comes into play "when the State presents psychiatric evidence of the defendant's future dangerousness."

A state habeas court subsequently determined that, under Atkins v. Virginia, 536 U. S. 304, and Hall v. Florida, 572 U. S. ___, Moore qualified as intellectually disabled and that his death sentence therefore violated the Eighth Amendment's proscription of "cruel and unusual punishments."
Petitioner Moore was convicted of capital murder and sentenced to death for fatally shooting a store clerk during a botched robbery that occurred when Moore was 20 years old.

A state habeas court subsequently determined that, under Atkins v. Virginia, 536 U. S. 304, and Hall v. Florida, 572 U. S. ___, Moore qualified as intellectually disabled and that his death sentence therefore violated the Eighth Amendment's proscription of "cruel and unusual punishments."

The habeas court followed the generally accepted intellectual-disability definition, which identifies three core elements: (1) intellectual-functioning deficits, (2) adaptive deficits, and (3) the onset of these deficits while still a minor.
The court consulted current medical diagnostic standards--the 11th edition of the American Association on Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities clinical manual (AAIDD-11) and the 5th edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders published by the American Psychiatric Association.

Based on its findings, the habeas court recommended to the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals (CCA) that Moore be granted relief.

The CCA declined to adopt the judgment recommended by the habeas court.
Based on its findings, the habeas court recommended to the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals (CCA) that Moore be granted relief.

The CCA held instead that the habeas court erred by not following the CCA's 2004 decision in Ex parte Briseno, 135 S. W. 3d 1, which adopted the definition of, and standards for assessing, intellectual disability contained in the 1992 (ninth) edition of the American Association on Mental Retardation manual (AAMR-9), predecessor to the current AAIDD-11 manual.
The CCA declined to adopt the judgment recommended by the habeas court.

Briseno also incorporated the AAMR-9's requirement that adaptive deficits must be "related" to intellectual-functioning deficits, and it recited, without citation to any medical or judicial authority, seven evidentiary factors relevant to the intellectual-disability inquiry.

Hall indicated that being informed by the medical community does not demand adherence to everything stated in the latest medical guide.

The CCA's conclusion that Moore's IQ scores established that he is not intellectually disabled is irreconcilable with Hall, which instructs that, where an IQ score is close to, but above, 70, courts must account for the test's "standard error of measurement."
But neither does precedent license disregard of current medical standards.

Because the lower range of Moore's adjusted IQ score of 74 falls at or below 70, the CCA had to move on to consider Moore's adaptive functioning.

The CCA also stressed Moore's improved behavior in prison, but clinicians caution against reliance on adaptive strengths developed in controlled settings.

The CCA also departed from clinical practice by requiring Moore to show that his adaptive deficits were not related to "a personality disorder."

For that reason, the court concluded, Moore's death sentence violated the Eighth Amendment's proscription of "cruel and unusual punishments."

The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals (CCA)1 declined to adopt the judgment recommended by the state habeas court.2 In the CCA's view, the habeas court erroneously employed intellectual-disability guides currently used in the medical community rather than the 1992 guides adopted by the CCA in Ex parte Briseno, 135 S.

The habeas court therefore recommended that Moore be granted relief.

The appeals court further determined that the evidentiary factors announced in Briseno "weigh[ed] heavily" against upsetting Moore's death sentence.
The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals (CCA)1 declined to adopt the judgment recommended by the state habeas court.2 In the CCA's view, the habeas court erroneously employed intellectual-disability guides currently used in the medical community rather than the 1992 guides adopted by the CCA in Ex parte Briseno, 135 S. W. 3d 1 (2004).

As we instructed in Hall, adjudications of intellectual disability should be "informed by the views of medical experts."
The appeals court further determined that the evidentiary factors announced in Briseno "weigh[ed] heavily" against upsetting Moore's death sentence.

That instruction cannot sensibly be read to give courts leave to diminish the force of the medical community's consensus.
As we instructed in Hall, adjudications of intellectual disability should be "informed by the views of medical experts."

Moreover, the several factors Briseno set out as indicators of intellectual disability are an invention of the CCA untied to any acknowledged source.

In 2014, the state habeas court conducted a two-day hearing on whether Moore was intellectually disabled.
Moore subsequently sought state habeas relief.

The court received affidavits and heard testimony from Moore's family members, former counsel, and a number of court-appointed mental-health experts.

The evidence revealed that Moore had significant mental and social difficulties beginning at an early age.
The court received affidavits and heard testimony from Moore's family members, former counsel, and a number of court-appointed mental-health experts.

At 13, Moore lacked basic understanding of the days of the week, the months of the year, and the seasons; he could scarcely tell time or comprehend the standards of measure or the basic principle that subtraction is the reverse of addition.

Cast out of his home, he survived on the streets, eating from trash cans, even after two bouts of food poisoning.
After failing every subject in the ninth grade, Moore dropped out of high school.

In evaluating Moore's assertion of intellectual disability, the state habeas court consulted current medical diagnostic standards, relying on the 11th edition of the American Association on Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities (AAIDD) clinical manual, see AAIDD, Intellectual Disability: Definition, Classification, and Systems of Supports (2010) (hereinafter AAIDD-11), and on the 5th edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders published by the American Psychiatric Association (APA), see APA, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (2013) (hereinafter DSM-5).
Cast out of his home, he survived on the streets, eating from trash cans, even after two bouts of food poisoning.

The court followed the generally accepted, uncontroversial intellectual-disability diagnostic definition, which identifies three core elements: (1) intellectual-functioning deficits (indicated by an IQ score "approximately two standard deviations below the mean"--i.e., a score of roughly 70--adjusted for "the standard error of measurement," AAIDD-11, at 27); (2) adaptive deficits ("the inability to learn basic skills and adjust behavior to changing circumstances," Hall v. Flor- ida, 572 U. S. ___, ___ (2014) (slip op., at 8)); and (3) the onset of these deficits while still a minor.

In determining the significance of adaptive deficits, clinicians look to whether an individual's adaptive performance falls two or more standard deviations below the mean in any of the three adaptive skill sets (conceptual, social, and practical).
The court credited six of Moore's IQ scores, the average of which (70.66) indicated mild intellectual disability.

Moore's performance fell roughly two standard deviations below the mean in all three skill categories.
In determining the significance of adaptive deficits, clinicians look to whether an individual's adaptive performance falls two or more standard deviations below the mean in any of the three adaptive skill sets (conceptual, social, and practical).

Based on this evidence, the state habeas court recommended that the CCA reduce Moore's sentence to life in prison or grant him a new trial on intellectual disability.

The CCA rejected the habeas court's recommendations and denied Moore habeas relief.
Based on this evidence, the state habeas court recommended that the CCA reduce Moore's sentence to life in prison or grant him a new trial on intellectual disability.

Briseno adopted the definition of, and standards for assessing, intellectual disability contained in the 1992 (ninth) edition of the American Association on Mental Retardation (AAMR) manual, predecessor to the current AAIDD-11 manual.
The CCA rejected the habeas court's recommendations and denied Moore habeas relief.

Briseno incorporated the AAMR-9's requirement that adaptive deficits be "related" to intellectual-functioning deficits.
Briseno adopted the definition of, and standards for assessing, intellectual disability contained in the 1992 (ninth) edition of the American Association on Mental Retardation (AAMR) manual, predecessor to the current AAIDD-11 manual.

The habeas judge erred, the CCA held, by "us[ing] the most current position, as espoused by AAIDD, regarding the diagnosis of intellectual disability rather than the test . . . in Briseno."
Briseno incorporated the AAMR-9's requirement that adaptive deficits be "related" to intellectual-functioning deficits.

The habeas judge erred, the CCA held, by "us[ing] the most current position, as espoused by AAIDD, regarding the diagnosis of intellectual disability rather than the test . . . in Briseno."

Thus, even though "[i]t may be true that the AAIDD's and APA's positions regarding the diagnosis of intellectual disability have changed since Atkins and Briseno," the CCA retained Briseno's instructions, both because of "the subjectivity surrounding the medical diagnosis of intellectual disability" and because the Texas Legislature had not displaced Briseno with any other guideposts.

Employing Briseno, the CCA first determined that Moore had failed to prove significantly subaverage intellectual functioning.
The Briseno inquiries, the court said, "remai[n] adequately 'informed by the medical community's diagnostic framework.' "

Rejecting as unreliable five of the seven IQ tests the habeas court had considered, the CCA limited its appraisal to Moore's scores of 78 in 1973 and 74 in 1989.
Employing Briseno, the CCA first determined that Moore had failed to prove significantly subaverage intellectual functioning.

The court then discounted the lower end of the standard-error range associated with those scores.
Rejecting as unreliable five of the seven IQ tests the habeas court had considered, the CCA limited its appraisal to Moore's scores of 78 in 1973 and 74 in 1989.

Regarding the score of 74, the court observed that Moore's history of academic failure, and the fact that he took the test while "exhibit[ing] withdrawn and depressive behavior" on death row, might have hindered his performance.
The court then discounted the lower end of the standard-error range associated with those scores.

Based on the two scores, but not on the lower portion of their ranges, the court concluded that Moore's scores ranked "above the intellectually disabled range" (i.e., above 70).
Regarding the score of 74, the court observed that Moore's history of academic failure, and the fact that he took the test while "exhibit[ing] withdrawn and depressive behavior" on death row, might have hindered his performance.

Based on the two scores, but not on the lower portion of their ranges, the court concluded that Moore's scores ranked "above the intellectually disabled range" (i.e., above 70).

True, the court acknowledged, Moore's and the State's experts agreed that Moore's adaptive-functioning test scores fell more than two standard deviations below the mean.
"Even if [Moore] had proven that he suffers from significantly sub-average general intellectual functioning," the court continued, he failed to prove "significant and related limitations in adaptive functioning."

But the State's expert ultimately discounted those test results because Moore had "no exposure" to certain tasks the testing included, "such as writing a check and using a microwave oven."
True, the court acknowledged, Moore's and the State's experts agreed that Moore's adaptive-functioning test scores fell more than two standard deviations below the mean.

Moore had demonstrated adaptive strengths, the CCA spelled out, by living on the streets, playing pool and mowing lawns for money, committing the crime in a sophisticated way and then fleeing, testifying and representing himself at trial, and developing skills in prison.

The habeas court had further erred, the CCA determined, by failing to consider whether any of Moore's adaptive deficits were related to causes other than his intellectualfunctioning deficits.
Those strengths, the court reasoned, undercut the significance of Moore's adaptive limitations.

Among alternative causes for Moore's adaptive deficits, the CCA suggested, were an abuse-filled childhood, undiagnosed learning disorders, multiple elementary-school transfers, racially motivated harassment and violence at school, and a history of academic failure, drug abuse, and absenteeism.
The habeas court had further erred, the CCA determined, by failing to consider whether any of Moore's adaptive deficits were related to causes other than his intellectualfunctioning deficits.

The CCA's conclusion that Moore's IQ scores established that he is not intellectually disabled is irreconcilable with Hall.
But neither does our precedent license disregard of current medical standards.

Hall instructs that, where an IQ score is close to, but above, 70, courts must account for the test's "standard error of measurement."
The CCA's conclusion that Moore's IQ scores established that he is not intellectually disabled is irreconcilable with Hall.

As we explained in Hall, the standard error of measurement is "a statistical fact, a reflection of the inherent imprecision of the test itself."
Hall instructs that, where an IQ score is close to, but above, 70, courts must account for the test's "standard error of measurement."

"For purposes of most IQ tests," this imprecision in the testing instrument "means that an individual's score is best understood as a range of scores on either side of the recorded score . . . within which one may say an individual's true IQ score lies."
As we explained in Hall, the standard error of measurement is "a statistical fact, a reflection of the inherent imprecision of the test itself."

A test's standard error of measurement "reflects the reality that an individual's intellectual functioning cannot be reduced to a single numerical score."
"For purposes of most IQ tests," this imprecision in the testing instrument "means that an individual's score is best understood as a range of scores on either side of the recorded score . . . within which one may say an individual's true IQ score lies."

Moore's score of 74, adjusted for the standard error of measurement, yields a range of 69 to 79, see 470 S. W. 3d, at 519, as the State's retained expert acknowledged, see Brief for Petitioner 39, n. 18; App.
A test's standard error of measurement "reflects the reality that an individual's intellectual functioning cannot be reduced to a single numerical score."

Both Texas and the dissent maintain that the CCA properly considered factors unique to Moore in disregarding the lower end of the standard-error range.
Because the lower end of Moore's score range falls at or below 70, the CCA had to move on to consider Moore's adaptive functioning.

But the presence of other sources of imprecision in administering the test to a particular individual, see post, at 14-16, and n. 3, cannot narrow the test-specific standard-error range.7
Both Texas and the dissent maintain that the CCA properly considered factors unique to Moore in disregarding the lower end of the standard-error range.

But the presence of other sources of imprecision in administering the test to a particular individual, see post, at 14-16, and n. 3, cannot narrow the test-specific standard-error range.7

Hall invalidated Florida's strict IQ cutoff because the cutoff took "an IQ score as final and conclusive evidence of a defendant's intellectual capacity, when experts in the field would consider other evidence."
In requiring the CCA to move on to consider Moore's adaptive functioning in light of his IQ evidence, we do not suggest that "the Eighth Amendment turns on the slightest numerical difference in IQ score," post, at 15-16.

Hall invalidated Florida's strict IQ cutoff because the cutoff took "an IQ score as final and conclusive evidence of a defendant's intellectual capacity, when experts in the field would consider other evidence."

Rather, in line with Hall, we require that courts continue the inquiry and consider other evidence of intellectual disability where an individual's IQ score, adjusted for the test's standard error, falls within the clinically established range for intellectual-functioning deficits.
Here, by contrast, we do not end the intellectual-disability inquiry, one way or the other, based on Moore's IQ score.

The CCA's consideration of Moore's adaptive functioning also deviated from prevailing clinical standards and from the older clinical standards the court claimed to apply.

In concluding that Moore did not suffer significant adaptive deficits, the CCA overemphasized Moore's perceived adaptive strengths.

Clinicians, however, caution against reliance on adaptive strengths developed "in a controlled setting," as a prison surely is.

The CCA furthermore concluded that Moore's record of academic failure, along with the childhood abuse and suffering he endured, detracted from a determination that his intellectual and adaptive deficits were related.
DSM-5, at 38 ("Adaptive functioning may be difficult to assess in a controlled setting (e.g., prisons, detention centers); if possible, corroborative information reflecting functioning outside those settings should be obtained.")

Clinicians rely on such factors as cause to explore the prospect of intellectual disability further, not to counter the case for a disability determination.
Those traumatic experiences, however, count in the medical community as "risk factors" for intellectual disability.

The CCA also departed from clinical practice by requiring Moore to show that his adaptive deficits were not related to "a personality disorder."
Clinicians rely on such factors as cause to explore the prospect of intellectual disability further, not to counter the case for a disability determination.

As mental-health professionals recognize, however, many intellectually disabled people also have other mental or physical impairments, for example, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, depressive and bipolar disorders, and autism.
The CCA also departed from clinical practice by requiring Moore to show that his adaptive deficits were not related to "a personality disorder."

("[c]o-occurring mental, neurodevelopmental, medical, and physical conditions are frequent in intellectual disability, with rates of some conditions (e.g., mental disorders, cerebral palsy, and epilepsy) three to four times higher than in the general population"); see AAIDD-11, at 58-63.
As mental-health professionals recognize, however, many intellectually disabled people also have other mental or physical impairments, for example, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, depressive and bipolar disorders, and autism.

By design and in operation, the Briseno factors "creat[e] an unacceptable risk that persons with intellectual disability will be executed," Hall, 572 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 1).
The CCA's attachment to the seven Briseno evidentiary factors further impeded its assessment of Moore's adaptive functioning.

After observing that persons with "mild" intellectual disability might be treated differently under clinical standards than under Texas' capital system, the CCA defined its objective as identifying the "consensus of Texas citizens" on who "should be exempted from the death penalty."

Skeptical of what it viewed as "exceedingly subjective" medical and clinical standards, the CCA in Briseno advanced lay perceptions of intellectual disability.
Mild levels of intellectual disability, although they may fall outside Texas citizens' consensus, nevertheless remain intellectual disabilities, see Hall, 572 U. S., at ___-___ (slip op., at 17-18); Atkins, 536 U. S., at 308, and n. 3; AAIDD-11, at 153, and States may not execute anyone in "the entire category of [intellectually disabled] offenders," Roper, 543 U. S., at 563-564 (emphasis added); see supra, at 9.

Briseno asks, for example, "Did those who knew the person best during the developmental stage--his family, friends, teachers, employers, authorities--think he was mentally retarded at that time, and, if so, act in accordance with that determination?"
Skeptical of what it viewed as "exceedingly subjective" medical and clinical standards, the CCA in Briseno advanced lay perceptions of intellectual disability.

Addressing that question here, the CCA referred to Moore's education in "normal classrooms during his school career," his father's reactions to his academic challenges, and his sister's perceptions of Moore's intellectual abilities.

For example, the related-ness requirement Texas defends here, see supra, at 5-6, is conspicuously absent from the standards the State uses to assess students for intellectual disabilities.
Indeed, Texas itself does not follow Briseno in contexts other than the death penalty.

And even within Texas' criminal-justice system, the State requires the intellectual-disability diagnoses of juveniles to be based on "the latest edition of the DSM."

In Moore's case, the habeas court applied current medical standards in concluding that Moore is intellectually disabled and therefore ineligible for the death penalty.

Just as we have corrected lower courts for taking it upon themselves to dismiss our precedent as outdated, see, e.g., Bosse v. Okla- homa, 580 U. S. ___, ___ (2016) (per curiam) (slip op., at 2), so too the CCA rebuked the habeas court for ignoring binding CCA precedent.

Briseno had stated a rule that in order for an Atkins claimant to demonstrate intellectual disability he must show (1) significantly subaverage general intellectual functioning and (2) related limitations in adaptive functioning, (3) which had appeared prior to age 18.
The CCA went on to explain why there was no reason to modify the legal standard it had previously set out.

It also laid out a set of seven evidentiary factors--the "Briseno factors"--designed to assist "factfinders . . . in weighing evidence" of intellectual disability.
Briseno had stated a rule that in order for an Atkins claimant to demonstrate intellectual disability he must show (1) significantly subaverage general intellectual functioning and (2) related limitations in adaptive functioning, (3) which had appeared prior to age 18.

The three-prong definition of intellectual disability came directly from the ninth edition of the manual published by what is now the American Association on Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities (AAIDD).
It also laid out a set of seven evidentiary factors--the "Briseno factors"--designed to assist "factfinders . . . in weighing evidence" of intellectual disability.

By the time Moore's case reached the CCA, the AAIDD no longer included the requirement that adaptive deficits be "related" to intellectual functioning.

By the time Moore's case reached the CCA, the AAIDD no longer included the requirement that adaptive deficits be "related" to intellectual functioning.

So the CCA was faced with a choice in Moore: Keeping the relatedness requirement would be inconsistent with the AAIDD's current guidance; dropping it would be out of step with the newest version of the DSM.
But, as the CCA noted, the most recent version of the other leading diagnostic manual, the DSM-5, did include that requirement.

Starting with intellectual functioning, the CCA conducted a painstaking analysis of the battery of tests Moore had taken over the past 40 years.
The CCA concluded that "the legal test we established in Briseno remains adequately 'informed by the medical community's diagnostic framework,' " and went on to evaluate the case under that approach.

The CCA concluded that five of the tests the habeas court had considered were unreliable: two of them were neuropsychological tests rather than formal IQ measures; two were group-administered tests, which Moore's own experts had criticized, App.
Starting with intellectual functioning, the CCA conducted a painstaking analysis of the battery of tests Moore had taken over the past 40 years.

That left two scores for the CCA to analyze: a 78 and a 74.
The CCA concluded that five of the tests the habeas court had considered were unreliable: two of them were neuropsychological tests rather than formal IQ measures; two were group-administered tests, which Moore's own experts had criticized, App.

"Taking into account the standard error of measurement" for the 78 score yielded a range of 73 to 83--i.e., a range that did not include an IQ of 70 or less.
Significantly subaverage intellectual functioning is "generally shown by an [IQ] of 70 or less."

As for the 74, the CCA again considered the standard error of measurement, which yielded a score range of 69 to 79.
"Taking into account the standard error of measurement" for the 78 score yielded a range of 73 to 83--i.e., a range that did not include an IQ of 70 or less.

The lower end of that range placed Moore within the parameters for significantly subaverage intellectual functioning.
As for the 74, the CCA again considered the standard error of measurement, which yielded a score range of 69 to 79.

The CCA found, however, that Moore's score was unlikely to be in the lower end of the error-generated range because he was likely exerting poor effort and experiencing depression at the time the test was administered--both factors that Moore's experts agreed could artificially deflate IQ scores.
The lower end of that range placed Moore within the parameters for significantly subaverage intellectual functioning.

The CCA accordingly concluded that Moore had failed to present sufficient evidence of significantly subaverage intellectual functioning.

Having failed one part of the CCA's three-part test, Moore could not be found intellectually disabled.
The CCA accordingly concluded that Moore had failed to present sufficient evidence of significantly subaverage intellectual functioning.

The CCA nonetheless went on to consider the second prong of the test, Moore's adaptive deficits.
Having failed one part of the CCA's three-part test, Moore could not be found intellectually disabled.

Moore had taken a standardized test of adaptive functioning in which he scored more than two standard deviations below the mean.
The CCA nonetheless went on to consider the second prong of the test, Moore's adaptive deficits.

But Dr. Kristi Compton, the state expert who had administered that test, explained that it was not an accurate measure of Moore's abilities.
Moore had taken a standardized test of adaptive functioning in which he scored more than two standard deviations below the mean.

She reached this conclusion not because of Moore's adaptive strengths but instead because "she had to assign zeroes to questions asking about areas to which [Moore] had no exposure, such as writing a check and using a microwave oven."
But Dr. Kristi Compton, the state expert who had administered that test, explained that it was not an accurate measure of Moore's abilities.

Dr. Compton further opined that her evaluation of Moore and review of documentary evidence--including school, trial, and prison records--did not show adaptive deficits sufficient for an intellectual disability diagnosis.
She reached this conclusion not because of Moore's adaptive strengths but instead because "she had to assign zeroes to questions asking about areas to which [Moore] had no exposure, such as writing a check and using a microwave oven."

Dr. Compton further opined that her evaluation of Moore and review of documentary evidence--including school, trial, and prison records--did not show adaptive deficits sufficient for an intellectual disability diagnosis.

As factfinders often do in confronting conflicting evidence, the CCA made a credibility determination.
The CCA also considered and recounted the testimony of the other experts who, unlike Dr. Compton, concluded that Moore had shown significant adaptive deficits.

The opinion of Dr. Compton, the CCA concluded, was "far more credible and reliable" than those of Moore's experts, given Dr. Compton's "considerable experience," "thorough[ ] and rigorous[ ] review[ ] [of] a great deal of material," and personal evaluation of Moore.

Finally, the CCA considered whether, even assuming that Moore had made sufficient showings as to intellectual functioning and adaptive deficits, those two were related.
Based on Dr. Compton's expert opinion, the CCA concluded Moore had failed to demonstrate significant adaptive deficits.

Again finding Dr. Compton's testimony the most credible, the CCA concluded that "the record overwhelmingly supports the conclusion" that Moore's observed academic and social difficulties stemmed, not from low intellectual abilities, but instead from outside factors like the trauma and abuse he suffered as a child and his drug use at a young age.
Finally, the CCA considered whether, even assuming that Moore had made sufficient showings as to intellectual functioning and adaptive deficits, those two were related.

The CCA explained that, in addition to Dr. Compton's expert testimony, consideration of the seven Briseno factors reinforced that relatedness conclusion.

"Eighth Amendment judgments should not be . . . merely the subjective views of individual Justices."

For that reason, we have emphasized that "judgment should be informed by objective factors to the maximum possible extent."

Recognizing that we have, in the very recent past, held that " 'the views of medical experts' do not 'dictate' a court's intellectual-disability determination," the Court assures us that it is not requiring adherence "to everything stated in the latest medical guide," ante, at 9-10 (quoting Hall, 572 U.

"Disregard" normally means to dismiss as unworthy of attention, and that is plainly not what the CCA did here.

As to prison conduct, the CCA decided that the fundamental questions the Atkins inquiry sought to answer were best considered--and "sound scientific principles" best served--by taking account of "all possible data that sheds light on a person's adaptive functioning, including his conduct in a prison society."

The court did not "disregard" medical standards.

The Court faults the CCA for "overemphasiz[ing]" strengths and "stress[ing]" Moore's conduct in prison, ante, at 12-13, suggesting that some--but not too much--consideration of strengths and prison functioning is acceptable.

But if courts do have "flexibility" in enforcing the guarantee of Atkins and need not "adhere[ ]" to these guides in every instance or particular, ante, at 10, 17, then clinical texts, standing alone, cannot answer the question of why the CCA placed too much weight on adaptive strengths and prison conduct.
The Court's only guidance on when "some" becomes "too much"?

The line between the permissible--consideration, maybe even emphasis--and the forbidden--"overemphasis"--is not only thin, but totally undefined by today's decision.

It is not at all clear when a State's deviation from medical consensus becomes so great as to "diminish the force" of that consensus, ante, at 2, and thereby violate the Constitution.
The line between the permissible--consideration, maybe even emphasis--and the forbidden--"overemphasis"--is not only thin, but totally undefined by today's decision.

It is not at all clear when a State's deviation from medical consensus becomes so great as to "diminish the force" of that consensus, ante, at 2, and thereby violate the Constitution.

In support of this proposition, the Court cites the AAIDD's direction that "significant limitations in conceptual, social, or practical adaptive skills [are] not outweighed by the potential strengths in some adaptive skills."
Finally, the Court's decision constitutionalizes rules for which there is not even clinical consensus--a consequence that will often arise from the approach charted by the Court today.

Even assuming that all clinicians would agree with this statement, there are a number of ways it might be interpreted: as meaning that strengths in one of the three adaptive skill areas--conceptual, social, and practical--should not cancel out deficits in another; as meaning that strengths should not outweigh deficits within the same skill area; or as meaning that evidence of some ability to perform a skill should not offset evidence of the inability to perform that same skill.
In support of this proposition, the Court cites the AAIDD's direction that "significant limitations in conceptual, social, or practical adaptive skills [are] not outweighed by the potential strengths in some adaptive skills."

You would not know it from reading the Court's opinion today, but that is precisely what the CCA--the factfinder under Texas law--did in the decision below: Confronted with dueling expert opinions about how to evaluate adaptive functioning and what conclusion to reach, the CCA resolved the dispute before it by accepting the testimony of the expert it deemed most credible.

As the Court explains, no state legislature has approved the use of these or any similar factors.

I need not decide this question, however, because the CCA reached the issue of Moore's adaptive functioning only after concluding that he had failed to demonstrate intellectual functioning sufficiently low to warrant a finding of intellectual disability, regardless of his adaptive deficits or their relationship to his IQ.

The Court concludes that the CCA's assessment of Moore's IQ scores is "irreconcilable with Hall."
Moore has not presented sufficient reason to upset that independent holding.

Hall rejected a Florida rule that required a prisoner to present an IQ score of 70 or below to demonstrate intellectual disability, thereby barring consideration of the standard error of measurement (SEM) of an over-70 score.
The Court concludes that the CCA's assessment of Moore's IQ scores is "irreconcilable with Hall."

But the CCA did not apply Florida's rule--or anything like it.
Hall rejected a Florida rule that required a prisoner to present an IQ score of 70 or below to demonstrate intellectual disability, thereby barring consideration of the standard error of measurement (SEM) of an over-70 score.

The court in fact began by taking account of the SEM, explaining that Moore's tested score of 74 led to an IQ range between 69 and 79.
But the CCA did not apply Florida's rule--or anything like it.

The court went on to consider additional expert testimony about potential factors affecting that score.
The court in fact began by taking account of the SEM, explaining that Moore's tested score of 74 led to an IQ range between 69 and 79.

Based on that evidence, the CCA discounted portions of the SEM-generated range and concluded that Moore's IQ did not lie in the relevant range for intellectual disability.
The court went on to consider additional expert testimony about potential factors affecting that score.

Hall provided no definitive guidance on this sort of approach: recognizing the inherent imprecision of IQ tests, but considering additional evidence to determine whether an SEM-generated range of scores accurately reflected a prisoner's actual IQ.1 Indeed, in its catalog of States that "ha[d] taken a position contrary to that of Florida," the Court in Hall included a State that granted trial courts discretion to draw "reasonable inferences" about IQ scores and, where appropriate, decline to consider the full range of the SEM.
Based on that evidence, the CCA discounted portions of the SEM-generated range and concluded that Moore's IQ did not lie in the relevant range for intellectual disability.

If that approach was "contrary" to Florida's rule in Hall, I do not understand how Hall can be read to reject that approach today.

Perhaps there are reasons to expand Hall's holding--to say that States must read IQ tests as rigidly encompassing the entire SEM range, regardless of any other evidentiary considerations, or to say that the reasons that the CCA gave for discounting the lower end of Moore's IQ range were improper.

The dissent suggests that Hall tacitly approved Idaho's approach to capital sentencing, which the dissent characterizes as "grant[ing] trial courts discretion to draw 'reasonable inferences' about IQ scores and, where appropriate, decline to consider the full range of the [standard error of measurement]."
Putting aside any heinousness or gruesomeness surrounding the capital offense, did the commission of that offense require forethought, planning, and complex execution of purpose?"

The Court's definition of deficient intellectual functioning as shown by "an IQ score" of roughly 70, ante, at 4 (emphasis added), is dicta and cannot be read to call into question the approach of States that would not treat a single IQ score as dispositive evidence where the prisoner presented additional higher scores.

Two cases are before us for review.
This scheme, we hold, offends the Fourteenth Amendment's guarantee of due process.

Petitioner Shannon Nelson, in 2006, was convicted by a Colorado jury of five counts--two felonies and three misdemeanors--arising from the alleged sexual and physical abuse of her four children.
Two cases are before us for review.

The trial court imposed a prison sentence of 20 years to life and ordered Nelson to pay court costs, fees, and restitution totaling $8,192.50.
Petitioner Shannon Nelson, in 2006, was convicted by a Colorado jury of five counts--two felonies and three misdemeanors--arising from the alleged sexual and physical abuse of her four children.

On appeal, Nelson's conviction was reversed for trial error.
The trial court imposed a prison sentence of 20 years to life and ordered Nelson to pay court costs, fees, and restitution totaling $8,192.50.

On retrial, a new jury acquitted Nelson of all charges.
On appeal, Nelson's conviction was reversed for trial error.

Petitioner Louis Alonzo Madden, in 2005, was convicted by a Colorado jury of attempting to patronize a prostituted child and attempted third-degree sexual assault by force.
On retrial, a new jury acquitted Nelson of all charges.

The trial court imposed an indeterminate prison sentence and ordered Madden to pay costs, fees, and restitution totaling $4,413.00.
Petitioner Louis Alonzo Madden, in 2005, was convicted by a Colorado jury of attempting to patronize a prostituted child and attempted third-degree sexual assault by force.

The Colorado Supreme Court reversed one of Madden's convictions on direct review, and a postconviction court vacated the other.
The trial court imposed an indeterminate prison sentence and ordered Madden to pay costs, fees, and restitution totaling $4,413.00.

Between Nelson's conviction and acquittal, the Colorado Department of Corrections withheld $702.10 from her inmate account, $287.50 of which went to costs and fees1 and $414.60 to restitution.
The State elected not to appeal or retry the case.

Following Madden's conviction, Madden paid Colorado $1,977.75, $1,220 of which went to costs and fees2 and $757.75 to restitution.
Between Nelson's conviction and acquittal, the Colorado Department of Corrections withheld $702.10 from her inmate account, $287.50 of which went to costs and fees1 and $414.60 to restitution.

The sole legal basis for these assessments was the fact of Nelson's and Madden's convictions.3 Absent those convictions, Colorado would have no legal right to exact and retain petitioners' funds.
Following Madden's conviction, Madden paid Colorado $1,977.75, $1,220 of which went to costs and fees2 and $757.75 to restitution.

Their convictions invalidated, both petitioners moved for return of the amounts Colorado had taken from them.

In Nelson's case, the trial court denied the motion outright.

In Madden's case, the postconviction court allowed the refund of costs and fees, but not restitution.
In Nelson's case, the trial court denied the motion outright.

The same Colorado Court of Appeals panel heard both cases and concluded that Nelson and Madden were entitled to seek refunds of all they had paid, including amounts allocated to restitution.
In Madden's case, the postconviction court allowed the refund of costs and fees, but not restitution.

Costs, fees, and restitution, the court held, must be "tied to a valid conviction," 369 P. 3d, at 627-628, absent which a court must "retur[n] the defendant to the status quo ante," 2013 WL 1760869, at *2.

A court must have statutory authority to issue a refund, that court stated.
The Colorado Supreme Court reversed in both cases.

As no other statute addresses refunds, the court concluded that the Exoneration Act is the "exclusive process for exonerated defendants seeking a refund of costs, fees, and restitution."

Due process therefore requires some mechanism "for the return of a defendant's money," Justice Hood maintained, 362 P. 3d, at 1080; as the Exoneration Act required petitioners to prove their innocence, the Act, he concluded, did not supply the remedy due process demands, id., at 1081.
Because neither petitioner has been validly convicted, he explained, each must be presumed innocent.

The Exoneration Act provides a civil claim for relief "to compensate an innocent person who was wrongly convicted."

Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Supreme Court of Colorado.
That scheme, we hold, does not comport with due process.

The familiar procedural due process inspection instructed by Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U. S. 319 (1976), governs these cases.
Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Supreme Court of Colorado.

Colorado argues that we should instead apply the standard from Medina v. California, 505 U. S. 437, 445 (1992), and inquire whether Nelson and Madden were exposed to a procedure offensive to a fundamental principle of justice.

Such rules concern, for example, the allocation of burdens of proof and the type of evidence qualifying as admissible.7 These cases, in contrast, concern the continuing deprivation of property after a conviction has been reversed or vacated, with no prospect of reprosecution.

Colorado urges, however, that the funds belong to the State because Nelson's and Madden's convictions were in place when the funds were taken.

Colorado urges, however, that the funds belong to the State because Nelson's and Madden's convictions were in place when the funds were taken.

"[A]xiomatic and elementary," the presumption of innocence "lies at the foundation of our criminal law."
But once those convictions were erased, the presumption of their innocence was restored.

Now suppose the trial court enters judgment on a guilty verdict, ordering cost, fee, and restitution payments by reason of the conviction, but the appeals court upsets the conviction for evidentiary insufficiency.
In that event, the defendant pays no costs, fees, or restitution.

The vulnerability of the State's argument that it can keep the amounts exacted so long as it prevailed in the court of first instance is more apparent still if we assume a case in which the sole penalty is a fine.
[I]t should make no difference that the reviewing court, rather than the trial court, determined the evidence to be insufficient."

On Colorado's reasoning, an appeal would leave the defendant emptyhanded; regardless of the outcome of an appeal, the State would have no refund obligation.

And when amounts a defendant seeks to recoup are not large, as is true in Nelson's and Madden's cases, see supra, at 2, the cost of mounting a claim under the Exoneration Act and retaining a lawyer to pursue it would be prohibitive.12
Furthermore, as Justice Hood noted in dissent, the Act provides no remedy at all for any assessments tied to invalid misdemeanor convictions (Nelson had three).

Colorado argued on brief that if the Exoneration Act provides sufficient process to compensate a defendant for the loss of her liberty, the Act should also suffice "when a defendant seeks compensation for the less significant deprivation of monetary assessments paid pursuant to a conviction that is later overturned."

Colorado also suggests that "numerous pre- and post-deprivation procedures"--including the need for probable cause to support criminal charges, the jury-trial right, and the State's burden to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt--adequately minimize the risk of erroneous deprivation of property.

The proper framework for analyzing these cases is provided by Medina v. California, 505 U. S. 437 (1992).
I agree that the judgments of the Colorado Supreme Court must be reversed, but I reach that conclusion by a different route.

In holding that these payments must be refunded, the Court relies on a feature of the criminal law, the presumption of innocence.
These cases concern Colorado's rules for determining whether a defendant can obtain a refund of money that he or she was required to pay pursuant to a judgment of conviction that is later reversed.

And since the Court demands that refunds occur either automatically or at least without imposing anything more than "minimal" procedures, see ante, at 10, it appears that they must generally occur as part of the criminal case.
In holding that these payments must be refunded, the Court relies on a feature of the criminal law, the presumption of innocence.

For these reasons, the refund obligation is surely "part of the criminal process" and thus falls squarely within the scope of Medina.

The Court applies the balancing test set out in Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U. S. 319 (1976), a modern invention "first conceived" to decide what procedures the government must observe before depriving persons of novel forms of property such as welfare or Social Security disability benefits.

This was "a remedy well known at common law," memorialized as "a part of the judgment of reversal which directed 'that the defendant be restored to all things which he has lost on occasion of the judgment aforesaid.' "
American law has long recognized that when an individual is obligated by a civil judgment to pay money to the opposing party and that judgment is later reversed, the money should generally be repaid.

As both parties acknowledge, this practice carried over to criminal cases.
This was "a remedy well known at common law," memorialized as "a part of the judgment of reversal which directed 'that the defendant be restored to all things which he has lost on occasion of the judgment aforesaid.' "

When a conviction was reversed, defendants could recover fines and monetary penalties assessed as part of the conviction.
As both parties acknowledge, this practice carried over to criminal cases.

The remedy was "equitable in origin and function," and return of the money was " 'not of mere right,' " but " 'rest[ed] in the exercise of a sound discretion.' "
The rule regarding recovery, however, "even though general in its application, [was] not without exceptions."

This was true in both civil and criminal cases.
The remedy was "equitable in origin and function," and return of the money was " 'not of mere right,' " but " 'rest[ed] in the exercise of a sound discretion.' "

In its Mathews analysis, the Court reasons that the reversal of petitioners' convictions restored the presumption of their innocence and that "Colorado may not presume a person, adjudged guilty of no crime, nonetheless guilty enough for monetary exactions."
Although long-established practice supports the Court's judgment, the Court rests its decision on different grounds.

The implication of this brief statement is that under Mathews, reversal restores the defendant to the status quo ante, see ante, at 3.

But the Court does not confront the obvious implications of this reasoning.
The implication of this brief statement is that under Mathews, reversal restores the defendant to the status quo ante, see ante, at 3.

For example, if the status quo ante must be restored, why shouldn't the defendant be compensated for all the adverse economic consequences of the wrongful conviction?
But the Court does not confront the obvious implications of this reasoning.

The Court cannot convincingly explain why Mathews' amorphous balancing test stops short of requiring a full return to the status quo ante when a conviction is reversed.
For example, if the status quo ante must be restored, why shouldn't the defendant be compensated for all the adverse economic consequences of the wrongful conviction?

The American legal system has long treated compensation for the economic consequences of a reversed conviction very differently from the refund of fines and other payments made by a defendant pursuant to a criminal judgment.

The Court flatly declares that the State is "obliged to refund . . . restitution" in just the same way as fees and court costs.

Although restitution may be included in a criminal judgment, it has many attributes of a civil judgment in favor of the victim.
This conclusion is not supported by historical practice, and it overlooks important differences between restitution, which is paid to the victims of an offense, and fines and other payments that are kept by the State.

This is clear under Colorado law.
Although restitution may be included in a criminal judgment, it has many attributes of a civil judgment in favor of the victim.

Entitlement to restitution need not be established beyond a reasonable doubt or in accordance with standard rules of evidence or criminal procedure.
Although the obligation to pay restitution is included in the defendant's sentence, restitution results in a final civil judgment against the defendant in favor of the State and the victim.

And the judgment may be enforced either by the State or the victim.
Entitlement to restitution need not be established beyond a reasonable doubt or in accordance with standard rules of evidence or criminal procedure.

Because a restitution order is much like a civil judgment, the reversal of the defendant's criminal conviction does not necessarily undermine the basis for restitution.
The Court ignores the distinctive attributes of restitution, but they merit attention.

Suppose that a victim successfully sues a criminal defendant civilly and introduces the defendant's criminal conviction on the underlying conduct as (potentially preclusive) evidence establishing an essential element of a civil claim.
Because a restitution order is much like a civil judgment, the reversal of the defendant's criminal conviction does not necessarily undermine the basis for restitution.

And suppose that the defendant's criminal conviction is later reversed for a trial error that did not (and could not) infect the later civil proceeding: for example, the admission of evidence barred by the exclusionary rule or a Confrontation Clause violation.
Suppose that a victim successfully sues a criminal defendant civilly and introduces the defendant's criminal conviction on the underlying conduct as (potentially preclusive) evidence establishing an essential element of a civil claim.

It would be unprecedented to suggest that due process requires unwinding the civil judgment simply because it rests in part on a criminal conviction that has since been reversed.
And suppose that the defendant's criminal conviction is later reversed for a trial error that did not (and could not) infect the later civil proceeding: for example, the admission of evidence barred by the exclusionary rule or a Confrontation Clause violation.

And a very similar scenario could unfold with respect to a Colorado restitution judgment.

The only salient difference would be that, in the Colorado case, the civil judgment would have been obtained as part of the criminal proceeding itself.

It is not clear (and the Court certainly does not explain) why that formal distinction should make a substantive difference.3

It is especially startling to insist that a State must provide a refund after enforcing a restitution judgment on the victims' behalf in reliance on a final judgment that is then vacated on collateral review.
It is not clear (and the Court certainly does not explain) why that formal distinction should make a substantive difference.3

Faced with this fact pattern, the Ninth Circuit declined to require reimbursement, reasoning that the Government was a mere "escrow agent" executing a then-valid final judgment in favor of a third party.

Its treatment of restitution is not grounded in any historical analysis, and--save for a brief footnote, ante, at 2-3, n. 3--the Court does not account for the distinctive civil status of restitution under Colorado law (or the laws of the many other affected jurisdictions that provide this remedy to crime victims).

Nor does the Court consider how restitution's unique characteristics might affect the balance that it strikes under Mathews.

The Court summarily rejects the proposition that " 'equitable considerations' " might militate against a blanket rule requiring the refund of money paid as restitution, see ibid., but why is this so?

It was unnecessary for the Court to issue a sweeping pronouncement on restitution.
And if the States and the Federal Government are always required to foot the bill themselves, would that risk discourage them from seeking restitution--or at least from providing funds to victims until the conclusion of appellate review?

But if the Court had to address this subject to dispose of these cases, it should have acknowledged that--at least in some circumstances--refunds of restitution payments made under later reversed judgments are not constitutionally required.

The majority and concurring opinions debate whether the procedural due process framework of Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U. S. 319 (1976), or that of Medina v. California, 505 U. S. 437 (1992), governs the question before us.

But both opinions bypass the most important question in these cases: whether petitioners can show a substantive entitlement to a return of the money they paid pursuant to criminal convictions that were later reversed or vacated.

The Court assumes, without reference to either state or federal law, that defendants whose convictions have been reversed have a substantive right to any money exacted on the basis of those convictions.
But both opinions bypass the most important question in these cases: whether petitioners can show a substantive entitlement to a return of the money they paid pursuant to criminal convictions that were later reversed or vacated.

By doing so, the Court assumes away the real issue in these cases.
The Court assumes, without reference to either state or federal law, that defendants whose convictions have been reversed have a substantive right to any money exacted on the basis of those convictions.

Colorado concedes that "if [petitioners] have a present entitlement" to the money--that is, if "it is their prop-erty"--"then due process requires [the State to accord] them some procedure to get it back."
As the parties have agreed, the existence of Colorado's obligation to provide particular procedures depends on whether petitioners have a substantive entitlement to the money.

And Colorado acknowledges that the procedural hurdles it could impose before returning the money "would be fairly minimal," id., at 51, because petitioners would need to prove only that their convictions had been reversed and that they had paid a certain sum of money, see ibid.
Colorado concedes that "if [petitioners] have a present entitlement" to the money--that is, if "it is their prop-erty"--"then due process requires [the State to accord] them some procedure to get it back."

Similarly, petitioners concede that if defendants in their position do not have a substantive right to recover the money--that is, if the money belongs to the State--then Colorado need not "provide any procedure to give it back."

Similarly, petitioners concede that if defendants in their position do not have a substantive right to recover the money--that is, if the money belongs to the State--then Colorado need not "provide any procedure to give it back."

In light of these concessions, I can see no justification for the Court's decision to address the procedures for adjudicating a substantive entitlement while failing to determine whether a substantive entitlement exists in the first place.
If defendants in their position have no entitlement to the money they paid pursuant to their reversed convictions, there would be nothing to adjudicate.

In my view, petitioners have not demonstrated that defendants whose convictions have been reversed possess a substantive entitlement, under either state law or the Constitution, to recover money they paid to the State pursuant to their convictions.
In light of these concessions, I can see no justification for the Court's decision to address the procedures for adjudicating a substantive entitlement while failing to determine whether a substantive entitlement exists in the first place.

Accordingly, I cannot agree with the Court's decision to reverse the judgments of the Colorado Supreme Court.
In my view, petitioners have not demonstrated that defendants whose convictions have been reversed possess a substantive entitlement, under either state law or the Constitution, to recover money they paid to the State pursuant to their convictions.

"Because the Constitution protects rather than creates property interests, the existence of a property interest is determined by reference to 'existing rules or understandings that stem from an independent source such as state law.' "
The Fourteenth Amendment provides that no State shall "deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law."

Petitioners undoubtedly have an "interest in regaining the money they paid to Colorado."
"Because the Constitution protects rather than creates property interests, the existence of a property interest is determined by reference to 'existing rules or understandings that stem from an independent source such as state law.' "

But to succeed on their procedural due process claim, petitioners must first point to a recognized property interest in that money, under state or federal law, within the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment.

Petitioners contend that the money remains their property under state law.

Colorado counters that when petitioners paid the money pursuant to their convictions, the costs and fees became property of the State and the restitution became property of the victims.
Petitioners contend that the money remains their property under state law.

The key premise of the Colorado Supreme Court's holdings in these cases is that moneys lawfully exacted pursuant to a valid conviction become public funds (or the victims' money) under Colorado law.
Colorado counters that when petitioners paid the money pursuant to their convictions, the costs and fees became property of the State and the restitution became property of the victims.

The Colorado Supreme Court explained in petitioner Shannon Nelson's case that "the trial court properly ordered [her] to pay costs, fees, and restitution pursuant to valid statutes" and that "the court correctly distributed th[ose] funds to victims and public funds, as ordered by the statutes."
The key premise of the Colorado Supreme Court's holdings in these cases is that moneys lawfully exacted pursuant to a valid conviction become public funds (or the victims' money) under Colorado law.

The Colorado Supreme Court further noted that, "[o]nce the state disburses restitution to the victims, the state no longer controls that money."

The Colorado Supreme Court further noted that, "[o]nce the state disburses restitution to the victims, the state no longer controls that money."

The Exoneration Act, the Colorado Supreme Court held, provides the only statutory authority for refunding costs, fees, and restitution when a defendant's conviction is overturned.
The Colorado Supreme Court explained that "Colorado's constitution protects" the Colorado Legislature's "control over public money," and thus a "court may authorize refunds from public funds only pursuant to statutory authority."

Because petitioners had not sought a refund under the Exoneration Act, "the trial court lacked the authority to order a refund of Nelson's costs, fees, and restitution."
The Exoneration Act, the Colorado Supreme Court held, provides the only statutory authority for refunding costs, fees, and restitution when a defendant's conviction is overturned.

At no point in this litigation have petitioners attempted to demonstrate that they satisfy the requirements of the Exoneration Act.
Because petitioners had not sought a refund under the Exoneration Act, "the trial court lacked the authority to order a refund of Nelson's costs, fees, and restitution."

Under the Act, Colorado recognizes a substantive entitlement to the kind of property at issue in these cases only if, among other things, the defendant can prove that he is "actually innocent.

It is the Exoneration Act alone which defines the scope of the substantive entitlement.

The majority responds by asserting, without citing any state law, that Colorado "had no legal right to retain [petitioners'] money" once their convictions were invalidated.
If petitioners want this Court to rewrite the contours of the substantive entitlement contained in the Exoneration Act, they err in invoking procedural due process.

If this were true as a matter of state law, then certain provisions of the Exoneration Act--which require the State to return costs, fees, and restitution only in limited circumstances following a conviction's reversal--would be superfluous.
The majority responds by asserting, without citing any state law, that Colorado "had no legal right to retain [petitioners'] money" once their convictions were invalidated.

Thus, to the extent the majority implicitly suggests that petitioners have a state-law right to an automatic refund (a point about which the majority is entirely unclear), it is plainly incorrect.

Because defendants in petitioners' position do not have a substantive right to recover the money they paid to Colorado under state law, petitioners' asserted right to an automatic refund must arise, if at all, from the Due Process Clause itself.

But the Due Process Clause confers no substantive rights.

In the absence of any property right under state law (apart from the right provided by the Exoneration Act, which petitioners decline to invoke), Colorado's refusal to return the money is not a "depriv[ation]" of "property" within the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment.

And no one disputes that Colorado cannot require petitioners to pay any additional costs, fees, or restitution now that their convictions have been invalidated.
No one disputes that if petitioners had never been convicted, Colorado could not have required them to pay the money at issue.

If the conviction is reversed, any restitution order dependent on that conviction is simultaneously vacated.
Under Colorado law, a restitution order tied to a criminal conviction is rendered as a separate civil judgment.

While these cases were pending in this Court, Colorado passed new legislation to provide "[r]eimbursement of amounts paid following a vacated conviction."

While these cases were pending in this Court, Colorado passed new legislation to provide "[r]eimbursement of amounts paid following a vacated conviction."

That legislation takes effect September 1, 2017, and has no effect on the cases before us.

Compensation under the Exoneration Act includes $70,000 per year of incarceration for the wrongful conviction; additional sums per year served while the defendant is under a sentence of death, or placed on parole or probation or on a sex offender registry; compensation for child support payments due during incarceration; tuition waivers at state institutions of higher education for the exonerated person and for any children conceived or legally adopted before the incarceration; and reasonable attorney's fees for bringing an Exoneration Act claim.

The presumption of innocence unquestionably fits that bill.
Under Medina, a criminal procedure violates due process if "it offends some principle of justice so rooted in the traditions and conscience of our people as to be ranked as fundamental."

Colorado invites a distinction between convictions merely "voidable," rather than "void," and urges that the invalidated convictions here fall in the voidable category.

More specifically, the Exoneration Act entitles an exonerated defendant to compensation if he was convicted of a felony, was incarcerated, and, among other requirements, can prove by clear and convincing evidence that he is "actually innocent," meaning that his "conviction was the result of a miscarriage of justice" or that he is factually innocent.
